</div>
<hr class="medium">

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">A good</span> many years ago, one of the toughest and hardest riders
that ever crossed Leicestershire undertook to perform a feat
which, just for the moment, attracted the general attention not
only of the country but of the sporting world. His bet was,
that, if he might choose his own turf, and if he might select as
many thorough-bred horses as he liked, he would undertake to
ride 200 miles in ten hours!!!</p>

<p>The newspapers of the day described exactly how “the Squire”
was dressed—what he had been living on—how he looked—how,
at the word “<cite>Away!</cite>” he started like an arrow from a bow—how
gallantly Tranby, his favourite racer, stretched himself in
his gallop—how, on arriving at his second horse, he vaulted from
one saddle to another—how he then flew over the surface of the
earth, if possible, faster than before—and how, to the astonishment
and amidst the acclamations of thousands of spectators, he
at last came in … a winner!</p>

<p>Now, if at this moment of his victory, while with dust and
perspiration on his brow—his exhausted arms dangling just
above the panting flanks of his horse, which his friends at each
side of the bridle were slowly leading in triumph—a decrepit old
woman had hobbled forward, and in the name of Science had
told the assembled multitude, that, before she became a skeleton,
she and her husband would undertake, instead of 200 miles in ten
hours, to go 500—that is to say, that, for every mile “the Squire”
had just ridden, she and her old man would go two miles and a
half—that she would moreover knit all the way, and that he
should take his medicine every hour and read to her just as if
they were at home; lastly, that they would undertake to perform
their feat either in darkness or in daylight, in sunshine or in
storm, “in thunder, lightning, or in rain;”—who, we ask, would
have listened to the poor maniac?—and yet how wonderfully
would her prediction have been now fulfilled! Nay, waggons of
coals and heavy luggage now-a-days fly across Leicestershire
faster and farther than Mr. Osbaldestone could go, notwithstanding
his condition and that of all his horses.</p>

<p>When railways were first established, every living being gazed
at a passing train with astonishment and fear: ploughmen held
their breath; the loose horse galloped from it, and then, suddenly
stopping, turned round, stared at it, and at last snorted
aloud. But the “nine days’ wonder” soon came to an end. As
the train now flies through our verdant fields, the cattle grazing
on each side do not even raise their heads to look at it; the timid
sheep fears it no more than the wind; indeed, the hen-partridge,
running with her brood along the embankment of a deep cutting,
does not now even crouch as it passes close by her. It is the same
with mankind. On entering a railway station, we merely mutter
to a clerk in a box where we want to go—say “<cite>How much?</cite>”—see
him horizontally poke a card into a little machine that
pinches it—receive our ticket—take our place—read our newspaper—on
reaching our terminus drive away perfectly careless of
all or of any one of the innumerable arrangements necessary for
the astonishing luxury we have enjoyed.</p>

<p>On the practical working of a railway there is no book extant,
nor any means open to the public of obtaining correct information
on the subject.</p>

<p>Unwilling, therefore, to remain in this state of ignorance
respecting the details of the greatest blessing which science has
ever imparted to mankind, we determined to make a very short
inspection of the practical machinery of one of our largest railways;
and having, on application to the Secretary, as also to the
Secretary of the Post-Office, been favoured with the slight
authorities we required, without companion or attendant we
effected our object; and although, under such circumstances, our
unbiassed observations were necessarily superficial, we propose,
first, to offer to our readers a faint outline of the difficulties
attendant upon the construction and maintenance of a great
railway, and then, by a few rough sketches, rapidly to pass in
review some of the scenes illustrative of the practical working
of the line, which we witnessed at the principal stations of the
London and North-Western Railway—say <span class="smcap">Euston</span>, <span class="smcap">Camden</span>,
<span class="smcap">Wolverton</span>, and <span class="smcap">Crewe</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">On the Construction of a Railway.</span></h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> the grand inauguration dinner eaten in Paris on the 28th of
December, 1848, for the express purpose of celebrating the installation
of the new President of the French Republic, it has
been recorded by the reporters present, that among the numerous
guests assembled, there was no one whose presence engrossed
such universal attention as that of an erect emaciated member of
“<i lang="fr">La Vieille Garde</i>.”</p>

<p>The old soldier, it is stated, as he sat at table, scarcely noticed
the constellations of bright, black, and hazel-coloured eyes that
from all directions were concentrated upon him, but, addressing
himself first to his own black bottle, and then with the utmost
good humour to those of his neighbours, he drank and ate—drank—swigged—reflected,—and
then, as if to refresh himself, drank
again, again, and again, until, according to pre-arrangement,
he stood up on the tribune to re-propose the health of “<span class="smcap">Louis
Napoleon</span>,” to which—coupling the meteor now shining in its
zenith with the “sun of Austerlitz,” which, though sunk for ever
below the horizon, still beamed as resplendently as ever within
his heart—he added, with great naïveté, “<span class="smcap">Mais sans oublier
l’autre!</span>”</p>

<p>The French people, or rather the representatives of the French
nation who were assembled, had received the consecutive orations
of several of the most illustrious of their fellow-citizens with
considerable marks of approbation; but when the veteran in question,
who was about seventy years of age, with hair white as snow,
rose to address to them a short speech that would scarcely have
filled his empty wine-glass, the sight of the uniform so dear to
Frenchmen—the tall bear-skin cap, the crimson feather, blue
coat, red facings, red worsted epaulettes, white breast, white
breeches, long black gaiters reaching over the knee, and, above
all, buttons with an eagle supporting the imperial crown—created
a storm of applause which it would be utterly impossible to describe.
For nearly a quarter of an hour shouts and clappings of
hands prevented the old warrior from opening his lips, and the applause
if possible increased when the veteran, with the palm of his
hand turned outwards, stiffly saluted the company in correct martial
style: and yet, strange to record, at the very moment of all this
military enthusiasm, so characteristic of a nation of whom it was
lately very eloquently stated “that it had been its ambition to
be the world’s guide and its destiny to be the world’s warning,”
the French Government was not only without funds to protect
public or private property, but, in fact, had nothing but the
plunder of both to conciliate and feed the multitude of misguided
and misguiding people who, by the ruin of commerce and by the
stagnation of trade, were literally all over France starving from
cold and hunger. Of their enthusiasm, therefore, as of that
of the veteran standing up before them, it may truly be said or
<span class="lock">sung—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Happy’s the soldier that lives on his pay,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And spends half-a-crown out of sixpence a-day!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Having related, or rather merely repeated, this curious little
anecdote, we will now endeavour to explain in what manner it
applies to the subject of our chapter, namely, “<em>the construction
of a railway</em>.”</p>

<p>It has been justly observed that “England is bound over to
keep the peace by a national debt, or penalty, of 800 millions.”
During the glorious expenditure of all this money, the attention
of the country was solely engrossed with the art, employment,
occupation, and victories of war. Our great statesmen were war-ministers—our
great men were naval and military warriors of all
ranks, whose noble bearing and gallant feats were joyfully announced,
and, by universal acclamation, as gratefully rewarded;
and if every man who took a government contract, or who in
any way came into contact with government, easily made a large
fortune by war, he, generally speaking, as rapidly spent it; and
thus an artificial circulation of wealth was kept up, which, like
the schoolboy’s mode of warming himself, commonly called
“beating the booby,” produced a temporary glow, estimated at
the moment to be of as much value as if it had naturally proceeded
from the heart.</p>

<p>The English people during the period in question drank hard.
The rule had scarcely an exception. As regularly as four
o’clock <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> struck, our noblemen, magistrates, judges, hunting
squires, and country gentlemen, began to look a little flushed—the
colour gradually increasing, until in due time they all became,
like their sun in a fog, red in the face. Before bedtime the
semi-rulers of the nation were half inebriated—some of our
leading statesmen being, alas! notoriously, very nearly in the
same state.</p>

<p>No sooner, however, were the British people, by the results of
1815, suddenly weaned from war, than their extraordinary natural
powers, moral as well as physical, invigorated by comparative
temperance, were directed to investigations, occupations, and
studies which rapidly produced their own rewards. Indeed, without
entering into details, the wealth which has been created
and amassed since the period in question, added to that with
which we have not only irrigated, but almost without metaphor
top-dressed the greater portion of the old as well as of the new
world, and, lastly, the extraordinary improvements that have
taken place in light, heat, locomotion—electrical as well as by
steam-power—machinery, in short in everything that administers
to human comfort, form altogether the golden harvest of our
labours; and thus, although to our eminent civil engineers considerable
credit is due, they are, in fact, but secondary causes;
the engineer-in-chief—the primary inventor—the real constructor
of our railways most indisputably being</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Construction of the Line.</span></h3>

<p>1. In considering the project of a railway, after fixing upon
the two termini, it becomes necessary to select the towns through
which it ought to pass.</p>

<p>2. When these have been determined, the chief engineer to
whom the investigation of the proposed line has been confided,
with the Ordnance map in his hand, walks and re-walks over the
whole length (Mr. Robert Stephenson, in his investigation of
the proposed line between London and Birmingham, walked
upwards of twenty times over the country between each), until
he feels that he carries in his mind the whole picture; and while
he is thus imagining and making out various lines for consideration,
his assistants are testing the eligibility of each by rapidly
taking for him what are called “flying levels,” as also “cross
levels,” along the principal ridges that at various angles intersect
the proposed line, and yet, notwithstanding the accuracy of these
mathematical precautions, it is almost invariably found that the
eye of the chief engineer has intuitively selected the best line.</p>

<p>It is, however, as painful to reflect on, as it is humiliating to
record, the prejudices, ignorance, passions, and artifice by which
our principal engineers were opposed, or rather by which they
were consecutively thwarted in the calm scientific investigations
for the benefit of the public which we have just described.</p>

<p>Instead of a general desire on the part of the community to
hail with gratitude, and to receive with open arms, an invention
which was practically not only to enable them with double
elbow-room, and at about half fares, to travel at four or five
times the speed which by their utmost efforts they had previously
been enabled to attain, but to afford similar facilities to millions
of tons of manufactures and merchandize, much of which had
either been impeded by delay, or altogether clogged by the
heavy charges on their transit, our engineers, in tracing the
lines for our great arterial railways, were but too often looked
upon as magicians, evil genii, or unclean spirits, whose unearthly
object was to fright the land from its propriety.</p>

<p>In many instances where it was proposed, by tapping the dull
stagnant population of a country town, to give vigour and animation
to its system, the inhabitants actually fancied that their
interests and their happiness would, like their habits, expire
under the operation.</p>

<p>For example, it is well known that one of the results of Mr.
R. Stephenson’s deliberate investigations was, that the present
London and North-Western Railway ought to pass through the
healthy and handsome town of Northampton,—an arrangement
which of course would instantaneously have given to it commercial
importance of inestimable value. The inhabitants, however,
urged and excited by men of influence and education,
opposed the blessing with such barbarous force, that they succeeded,
to their everlasting punishment, in distorting the line—<i>viâ</i>
the Kilsby Tunnel, which, if the projected plan had been
adopted, would not have been required—to a point five miles
off! and if such ignorance could, in the nineteenth century,
exist in a large and populous town, it cannot be a
matter of surprise that our engineers should have had to encounter
similar, or, if possible, still greater prejudices in rural
districts.</p>

<p>It was there generally considered to be utterly incredible that
a railway could ever possibly supersede our mail and stage
coaches; at market meetings, and at market dinners, the invention
was looked upon as, and declared to be, “a smoky
substitute for canals;” and while men of property inveighed
against its unsightly appearance, their tenants were equally
opposed to the measure.</p>

<p>For instance, among the <em>reasons</em> for preventing the present
London and North-Western Railway coming to Northampton,
it was seriously urged by many very wealthy and respectable
graziers in the neighbourhood, that the smoke of the passing
engines would seriously discolour the wool of their sheep; that
the continual progress through their verdant meadows of a sort of
rumbling, hissing, fiery serpent, would, by continually alarming,
fretting, and distracting the attention of their cattle, prevent
them, “poor things!” from fattening; in short, such was the opposition
to the new system, that one of the engineers employed by
the London and North-Western Railway to trace out a branch
line (which, at a considerable expense to the Company, was to
confer inestimable advantages upon its locality) was attacked by
the proprietors of the soil, and a conflict or battle royal ensued,
which ended in very serious legal results.</p>

<p>3. As soon as the chief engineer has, instead of the <em>best</em> line
of railway that could have been determined on, decided on that
which, for the <em>reasons</em> stated, it is <em>advisable</em> he should recommend—alas!
what a pity it is that, in the construction of our great
arterial railways, such a discreditable difference should have been
allowed to exist!!—he employs his assistant engineers and surveyors
to make for him accurate surveys, and to take correct
sections, copies of which are to be deposited, according to Act
of Parliament, with the various clerks of the peace of the several
counties through which the line is to pass, with the Commissioners
of Railways, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.; besides which there is to be
prepared for each parish its proportion, as also for every landholder
a section, showing the greatest depth of cutting or embankment
in any of his fields.</p>

<p>In addition to the collection and construction of all these data
and drawings, notices are to be served upon every landowner,
wherever he may be, in the United Kingdom; for which duty
in 1845 almost everybody that could be picked up was engaged,
the number of horses employed and <em>killed</em> in the operation
having been utterly incalculable.</p>

<p>4. By the time these expenses have been incurred, the attention
of the chief engineer is engrossed by a new struggle of vital
importance, practically called “<cite>the fight for the Act</cite>,” in both
houses of Parliament.</p>

<p>As the question before the reader is abstractedly one of science,
we gladly refrain from staining it by the slightest political
remark; we will therefore, on this branch of the subject,
only state that, from returns which have officially been published,
it appears that, in the years 1845, 1846, and 1847, more than ten
millions were expended in parliamentary inquiries and parliamentary
contests.</p>

<p>This money would, at the rate of 20,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> per mile, have constructed
a national railway 500 miles in length—say from London
to Aberdeen!</p>

<p>Casting aside the bitter mortification which these expenses
must create to the man of science, whose mind is enthusiastically
engrossed with the vast importance of railway communication,
the permanent tax which they inflict upon the public can very
briefly be demonstrated.</p>

<p>Supposing 5 per cent. be deemed an adequate return to railway
proprietors for the capital they have expended, the comparative
charges to be levied by them on every passenger or ton
of goods would be as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<table class="small">
<tr><td class="tdh">Charge per mile on a railway which ought to have cost

    <td class="tdc vlb">„</td></tr>
</table>

<p>5. As soon as the Act of Parliament has been obtained, the
chief engineer directs the immediate construction of a most
accurate plan and section of the whole line, from which he ascertains
and lays down its gradients. He then determines the sizes
of the bridges required, as also the nature and amount of masonry
for each; he calculates the quantities of embankments and cuttings,
balancing the one against the other as nearly as circumstances
will allow, and having, by first boring, and afterwards by
the sinking of “trial shafts,” ascertained as accurately as possible
the nature of the various strata to be excavated or tunnelled,
he proceeds to estimate in detail the cost of the several works,
which he then divides into lengths for construction, taking
care that in each the amount of earth to be excavated and filled
up shall as nearly as possible balance each other; in short,
inasmuch as all contractors prudently, and indeed very properly,
invariably lower their tenders in proportion as the work they
are required to execute has been clearly laid open to their view,
and, on the other hand, to secure themselves from unknown
difficulties, as invariably <em>raise</em> their tenders for work which has
not been sufficiently bored or examined, he is fully sensible that
a considerable saving in the cost of the proposed railway will
be effected by a clear preliminary development of its works.</p>

<p>6. This mass of information having been prepared, the chief
engineer now advertises his work in its various lengths for execution
by contract, and, on receiving tenders for the same, he
selects, not always the <em>lowest</em>, but that which, for various reasons,
is the most <em>approved</em>, taking security generally to the amount of
10 per cent. of the contract.</p>

<p>Previous, however, to the reception of the tenders the chief
engineer appoints his staff of assistants. To each 40 or 50 miles
there is usually appointed an experienced engineer, having under
him “<em>sub-assistants</em>” who superintend from 10 to 15 miles
each—these sub-assistants being again assisted by “<em>inspectors</em>”
of masonry, of mining, of earth-work, and of permanent way, to
each of whom a particular district is assigned.</p>

<p>7. The chief engineer now finds himself engaged in a new
struggle with man in addition to nature. In many instances
the contractors let out a portion of the work they have engaged
to perform to sub-contractors, who again “set” the earth-work
to a body of “navvies,” who again among themselves sub-divide
it among the three branches of which their State is composed,
namely, “excavators,” “trenchers,” and “runners,” each party
of whom appoint their own “ganger.”</p>

<p>The duty of effectually overlooking all these details, of preventing
collusion as well as collision, of enforcing the due execution
of the contract, and yet, where necessary, occasionally to
alleviate the strict letter of its law, constitute perhaps the most
harassing of the various difficulties which the chief engineer has
to overcome: for it must be evident that if, by means of bribery,
or from inattention, or from sheer roguery, any important portion
of the work be “scamped,” or insufficiently performed, results
may ere long occur of the most serious description.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tunnels.</span></h3>

<p>8. The brief history of the construction of the Kilsby Tunnel
of the London and North-Western Railway very strikingly demonstrates
the latent difficulties which occasionally evade the
investigations, baffle the calculations, and which, by chastening
as well as by humbling, eventually elevate the mind of every
man of science who has practically to contend with the hidden
secrets of the crust of the earth which we inhabit.</p>

<p>The proposed tunnel was to be driven about 160 feet below
the surface. It was to be, as indeed it is, 2399 yards 2 feet
6 inches in length, with two shafts of the extraordinary size of
60 feet in diameter, not only to give air and ventilation, but to
admit light enough to enable the engine-driver in passing
through it with a train to see the rails from end to end.</p>

<p>In order correctly to ascertain, and honestly to make known
to the contractors, the nature of the ground through which this
great work was to pass, the engineer in chief sank the usual
number of what are termed “trial shafts,” and, it clearly appearing
therefrom that the principal portion of the stratum was the
shale of the lower oolite, the usual advertisements for tenders
were issued, and the shafts, &amp;c., having been minutely examined
by the competing contractors, the work was let to one of them
for the sum of 99,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr></p>

<p>In order to drive the tunnel, it was deemed necessary to construct
18 working shafts, by which, like the heavings of a mole,
the contents of the subterranean gallery were to be brought to
the surface.</p>

<p>This interesting work was in busy progress, when all of a
sudden it was ascertained, that at about 200 yards from the south
end of the tunnel, there existed, overlaid by a bed of clay 40 feet
thick, a hidden quicksand, which extended 400 yards into the
proposed tunnel, and which the trial shafts on each side of it
had almost miraculously just passed without touching.</p>

<p>The traveller in India could scarcely be more alarmed at the
sudden sight of a crouching tiger before him, than the contractor
was at the unexpected appearance of this invincible enemy.
Overwhelmed at the discovery, he instantly took to his bed, and
though he was liberally, or, to speak more correctly, justly relieved
by the Company from his engagement, the reprieve came
too late, for he actually died!</p>

<p>The question then arose whether, in the face of this tremendous
difficulty, the execution of the Kilsby Tunnel should be continued
or abandoned. The general opinion of the several eminent
engineers who were consulted was against proceeding, and certainly
the amount of the difficulties which were subsequently
incurred, justified the verdict. But in science, as well as in war,
the word “<span class="allsmcap">IM</span><em>possible</em>” can occasionally, by cool and extraordinary
exertions, be divested of its first syllable; and accordingly,
Mr. Robert Stephenson offering, after mature reflection,
to undertake the responsibility of proceeding, he was duly
authorised to do so.</p>

<p>His first operation was of course to endeavour by the power
of steam-engines—the comrades of his life—to lower the water
with which he had to contend; and although, to a certain degree,
this attempt succeeded, yet by the draining of remote springs, and
by the sinking of the water in wells at considerable distances, it
was soon ascertained that the quicksand in question covered
several square miles.</p>

<p>The tunnel, 30 feet high by 30 feet broad, arched at the
top as well as the bottom, was formed of bricks laid in cement,
and the bricklayers were progressing in “lengths” averaging
12 feet, when those who were nearest the quicksand,
on driving into the roof, were suddenly almost overwhelmed by
a deluge of water which burst in upon them. As it was evident
that no time was to be lost, a gang of workmen, protected by the
extreme power of the engines, were with their materials placed
on a raft; and while, with the utmost celerity, they were completing
the walls of that short length, the water, in spite of every
effort to keep it down, rose with such rapidity, that at the conclusion
of the work the men were so near being jammed against
the roof, that the assistant-engineer, Mr. Charles Lean, in charge
of the party, jumped overboard, and then, swimming with a rope
in his mouth, he towed the raft to the foot of the nearest working
shaft, through which he and his men were safely lifted up into
daylight, or, as it is termed by miners, “<cite>to grass</cite>.”</p>

<p>The water now rose in the shaft, and as it is called “drowned
out” the works. For a considerable time all the pumping apparatus
appeared to be insufficient. Indeed the effort threatened
to be so hopeless that the Directors of the Company almost
determined to abandon it, but the engineer-in-chief, relying on
the power of his engines, prayed for one fortnight more; before
that period expired Science triumphed over her subterranean
foe, and—thanks to the inventors of the steam-engine—the water
gradually lowered.</p>

<p>By the main strength of 1250 men, 200 horses, and 13 steam-engines,
not only was the work gradually completed, but during
night and day, for eight months, the astonishing and almost incredible
quantity of 1800 gallons per <em>minute</em> from the quicksand
alone was raised by Mr. Robert Stephenson and conducted
away!!</p>

<p>Indeed such is the eagerness with which workmen in such
cases proceed, that, on a comrade being one day killed at their
side by falling down the shaft, they merely, like sailors in
action, chucked his body out of the way and then instantly proceeded
with their work. In the construction of the tunnel there
were lost twenty-six men, two or three of whom were “navvies,”
killed in trying, “for fun,”—as they termed it—to jump one
after another across the summits of the shafts.</p>

<p>The time occupied from the laying of the first brick to the
completion of the work was thirty months. The number of
bricks used was 36,000,000, sufficient to make a good footpath
from London to Aberdeen (missing the Forth) a yard broad!</p>

<p>On the completion of this great work the large populous village
which had been constructed on its summit was of course suddenly
deserted; it has since completely disappeared, and, instead
of the busy scenes it once witnessed, there is now nothing heard
on the dreary summit of the Kilsby Tunnel but the desolate
moan of the rumbling train, or the occasional subterranean
whistle of its engine; these noises being followed by the appearance
of a slight smoke slowly meandering upwards from the two
great shafts of the tunnel.</p>

<p>During the operations we have just described, an artificer who
had been working in the tunnel was ascending one of the shafts
when, the back of his coat happening to get into an angular
crevice of the partition, called by miners a “<cite>brattice</cite>,” which
separated the shaft from the pumps, it became so completely
jammed therein that the man was obliged to let go the rope, and
accordingly, while dangling over his head it rose to the surface,
he remained, to the utter astonishment and dismay of his comrades,
suspended about 100 feet from the bottom, until some of
them descended and rescued him by cutting away the imprisoned
piece of his coat, which, on being afterwards extricated, was
long preserved in the engineer’s office as a trophy demonstrating
the strength of good honest English broadcloth.</p>

<p>At the same shaft an accident of exactly a contrary nature
subsequently occurred. In order to execute some trifling repair
to the brattice, there was, during a desperate cold night, suspended,
about half-way down the shaft, a temporary scaffolding
on which several artificers were working by candle-light, when
all of a sudden a well-known powerful “navvy,” named Jack
Pierson, fell from the surface with such momentum, that, breaking
through the frail scaffolding as if it had been tinder, he was
in a few seconds heard to go souse into the water at a considerable
depth beneath!</p>

<p>As soon as the men on the scaffold had recovered from their
surprise they naturally all at once were animated with a desire
to save their comrade. One lustily roared out for rope; another
vociferously proposed something else; while several navvies,
bawling from the surface, were each as eagerly and as loudly
prescribing his own remedy. In the midst of this confusion the
stentorian voice of Jack Pierson himself was heard, from the very
bottom of the pit, calmly to exclaim,</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Darm your eyes, make less noise and pool me
arout!!</span>”</p>

<p>His rough command was instantly attended to, and he was
moreover carried to his bed, where, poor fellow! he lay many
weeks unable to move.</p>

<p>Besides the 1250 labourers employed in the construction of
the tunnel, a proportionate number of suttlers and victuallers of
all descriptions concentrated upon the village of Kilsby. In
several houses there lodged in each room sixteen navvies, and
as there were four beds in each apartment, two navvies were
constantly in each; the two squads of eight men as alternately
changing places with each other in their beds as in their work.</p>

<p>Such was the demand for lodging that it was, as we have stated,
found necessary to construct a large village over the tunnel for
the accommodation of the workmen, and, as they generally
allowed themselves three meat meals a-day, it has been asserted
that more beef was eaten at Kilsby during the construction of the
tunnel than had previously been consumed there since the Deluge.</p>

<p>As these navigators are now before us, we trust that our
readers will not only be curious but desirous to know a little
more of the habits of a set of men who have lately added so
materially to the prosperity of the country as well as to our
luxuries, by the numerous railways which, by the honest sweat
of their brows, they have one after another executed.</p>

<p>We need hardly say that, as regards their physical strength,
they are the finest Herculean specimens of the British race; and,
as is generally the case, in proportion as they are powerful so
are they devoid of all bluster or bravado.</p>

<p>Those who have commanded large numbers of them state that
they are not only obedient to all above them, even to their own
“gangers,” but that, although they have—we think very justly—occasionally
required a permanent increase of pay, they have
never meanly taken advantage of a press of business to strike for
wages. Indeed the conduct of a “navvy,” like his countenance,
is honest and open. If from illness or misfortune he is unable
to work, he and his family are maintained by his comrades; in
truth the same provision is made among them for what are called
by navvies their “<cite>tally-wives</cite>,” a description of relationship
exceedingly difficult <em>correctly</em> to describe.</p>

<p>As they earn high wages, it is a fashion among them to keep
dogs; and as rather a noble trait, we may mention that there
have been several instances where 10<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> has been in vain offered to
“a navvy” to induce him to sell his dumb favourite.</p>

<p>Generally speaking they are not addicted to poaching; but
when not at work they usually amuse themselves by playing at
skittles, at quoits, by drinking, and occasionally by fighting; and
although the latter species of recreation is no doubt reprehensible,
yet surely it is better for a man to walk homewards at night
with a pair of black eyes and a bloody nose, than with an I O U
cheque in his pocket for ten thousand pounds, gained by what
the fashionable world terms “at <em>play</em>” from a companion whose
wife he has made destitute, and whose children he has probably
ruined!</p>

<p>At a navvy’s funeral 500 of his comrades in their clean
short white smock-frocks, with thin black handkerchiefs tied
loosely round their throats, are seen occasionally in procession
walking in pairs hand in hand after the coffin of their
mate. In short, there exists among them a friendly “<i lang="fr">esprit de
corps</i>,” which not only binds them together, but renders it rather
dangerous for any stranger to cheat, or even to endeavour to
overreach them.</p>

<p>During the construction of the present London and North-Western
Railway, a landlady at Hillmorton, near Rugby, of very
sharp practice, which she had imbibed in dealings for many years
with canal boatmen, was constantly remarking aloud that no
navvy should ever “<em>do</em>” her; and although the railway was in
her immediate neighbourhood, and although the navvies were
her principal customers, she took pleasure on every opportunity
in repeating the invidious remark.</p>

<p>It had, however, one fine morning scarcely left her large, full-blown,
rosy lips, when a fine-looking young fellow, walking up
to her, carrying in both hands a huge stone bottle, commonly
called “a grey-neck,” briefly asked her for “half a gallon of
gin;” which was no sooner measured and poured in than the
money was rudely demanded before it could be taken away.</p>

<p>On the navvy declining to pay the exorbitant price asked, the
landlady, with a face like a peony, angrily told him he must
either pay for the gin or <em>instantly</em> return it.</p>

<p>He silently chose the latter, and accordingly, while the eyes
of his antagonist were wrathfully fixed upon his, he returned into
her measure the half-gallon, and then quietly walked off; but
having previously put into his grey-neck half a gallon of water,
each party eventually found themselves in possession of half a
gallon of gin and water; and, however either may have enjoyed
the mixture, it is historically recorded at Hillmorton that the
landlady was never again heard unnecessarily to boast “that no
navvy could ‘<em>do</em>’ her.”</p>

<p>A navvy at Kilsby, being asked why he did not go to church?
dully answered in geological language—“<cite>Why, Soonday hasn’t
cropped out here yet!</cite>” By which he meant that the clergyman
appointed to the new village had not yet arrived.</p>

<p>The contrast which exists between the character of the French
and English navigator may be briefly exemplified by the following
trifling <span class="lock">anecdote:—</span></p>

<p>In excavating a portion of the first tunnel east of Rouen
towards Paris, a French miner dressed in his blouse, and an
English “navvy” in his white smock jacket, were suddenly buried
alive together by the falling in of the earth behind them. Notwithstanding
the violent commotion which the intelligence of
the accident excited above ground, Mr. Meek, the English engineer
who was constructing the work, after having quietly measured
the distance from the shaft to the sunken ground, satisfied
himself that if the men, at the moment of the accident, were
at the head of “the drift” at which they were working, they
would be safe.</p>

<p>Accordingly, getting together as many French and English
labourers as he could collect, he instantly commenced sinking
a shaft, which was accomplished to the depth of 50 feet in the
extraordinary short space of eleven hours, and the men were thus
brought up to the surface alive.</p>

<p>The Frenchman, on reaching the top, suddenly rushing forwards,
hugged and embraced on both cheeks his friends and
acquaintances, many of whom had assembled, and then, almost
instantly overpowered by conflicting feelings,—by the recollection
of the endless time he had been imprisoned—and by the joy of
his release,—he sat down on a log of timber, and, putting
both his hands before his face, he began to cry aloud most
bitterly.</p>

<p>The English “navvy” sat himself down on the very same piece
of timber—took his pit-cap off his head—slowly wiped with it
the perspiration from his hair and face—and then, looking for
some seconds into the hole or shaft close beside him through
which he had been lifted, as if he were calculating the number
of cubic yards that had been excavated, he quite coolly, in broad
Lancashire dialect, said to the crowd of French and English who
were staring at him as children and nursery-maids in our London
Zoological Gardens stand gazing half terrified at the white
bear,</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Yaw’ve bean a darmnation short toime abaaowt
it!</span>”</p>

<p>In the construction of the London and North-Western Railway,
the contractor at Blisworth also failed and also died.</p>

<p>Besides the perpendicular cutting which he had undertaken to
execute, there was, on the surface of the rock through which it
now passes, a stratum of about twenty feet of clay of so slippery a
nature, that for a considerable time, in spite of all efforts or precautions,
it continued to flow over into the cutting like porridge.
The only remedy which could be applied was, at vast
labour and expense, to remove this stratum for a considerable
distance, terminating it by a slope at a very flat angle, all of
which extra labour, trouble, and expense, we may observe, is not
only unseen but unknown to the traveller, who, as he flies through
the tunnel, if he looks at the summit at all, naturally fancies that
it forms the upper extremity of the work.</p>

<p>In the construction of the tunnel at Walford an accident occurred
of rather a serious nature. A mass of loose gravel concealed
in the chalk, slipping <i>viâ</i> the shaft into the tunnel, suddenly
killed eleven men, besides letting down from the surface a horse
and gin.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cuttings.</span></h3>

<p>9. In passing through the consecutive cuttings of a great railway,
the traveller usually considers that those through rock
must have been desperate undertakings, infinitely more expensive
than those through clay. The cost of both, however,
is nearly equal; for, not only does the perpendicular rock-cutting
require infinitely less excavation than the wide yawning
earth one of the same depth, but when once executed the former
is not liable to the expensive slips which subsequently occasionally
afflict the latter.</p>

<p>In determining whether the line should proceed by tunnelling
or by cutting, the engineer’s rule usually is to prefer
the latter for any depth less than sixty feet; after which it
is generally cheaper to tunnel. If, however, earth be wanted
for a neighbouring embankment, it becomes of course a matter of
calculation whether it may not be cheaper to make a cutting
instead of what abstractedly ought otherwise to have been a
tunnel.</p>

<p>In the construction of the Tring cutting alone of the present
London and North-Western Railway, there were excavated
1,297,763 cubic yards of chalk, of which about fifteen cubic feet
weighed a ton.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Embankments.</span></h3>

<p>10. Besides contending with water above ground as well as
below, the constructor of a railway is occasionally assailed by an
element of a very different nature. For instance, when the Wolverhampton
embankment of the present London and North-Western
Railway, at vast trouble and expense, was nearly
finished, it was observed first to smoke, then get exceedingly hot,
until a slow mouldering flame visible at night appeared. The
bank began to consume away, and the heat continued until it
actually burned the railway sleepers; at last, however, it exhausted
itself. The combustion was caused by the quantity of
sulphuret of iron or pyrites contained in the earth of the embankment,
which, having been baked by the fire, will probably
never slip.</p>

<p>11. It would be tedious, and indeed impossible, to detail the
various works which a railway engineer has to superintend in
the construction of the line, in the laying down of the rails or
“permanent way,” and in the subsequent, or rather simultaneous,
erection of the various station-houses, storehouses, workshops, &amp;c.
&amp;c., the interior of which we shall soon have occasion to enter.</p>

<p>An idea, however, of the magnitude of his operations may be
faintly imparted by the following brief abstract of a series of
calculations made by Mr. Lecount, one of the engineers employed
in the construction of the southern division of the present
London and North-Western Railway, and the writer of the
article ‘<cite>Railways</cite>’ in the ‘Encyclopædia Britannica.’ The
great Pyramid of Egypt was, according to Diodorus Siculus,
constructed by three hundred thousand—according to Herodotus
by one hundred thousand—men; it required for its execution
twenty years, and the labour expended on it has been estimated
as equivalent to lifting 15,733,000,000 of cubic feet of stone one
foot high. Now, if in the same manner the labour expended in
constructing the Southern Division only of the present London and
North-Western Railway be reduced to one common denomination,
the result is 25,000,000,000 cubic feet of similar material lifted
to the same height; being 9,267,000,000 of cubic feet <em>more</em> than
was lifted for the pyramid; and yet the English work was performed
by about 20,000 men only, in less than five years.</p>

<p>Again, it has been calculated by Mr. Lecount that the
quantity of earth moved in the single division (112½ miles in
length) of the railway in question would be sufficient to make a
foot-path a foot high and a yard broad round the whole circumference
of the earth! the <em>cost</em> of this division of the railway
in penny-pieces being sufficient to form a copper kerb or edge to
it. Supposing therefore the same proportionate quantity of
earth to be moved in the 7150 miles of railway sanctioned by
Parliament at the commencement of 1848 (<i>Vide</i> Parliamentary
Returns), our engineers within about fifteen years would, in the
construction of our railways alone, have removed earth sufficient
to girdle the globe with a road one foot high and one
hundred and ninety-one feet broad!</p>

<p>Abandoning, however, speculations of this nature, we will
conclude our slight sketch of the principal works required for a
railway by a few data, exemplifying the magnitude of the Britannia
Bridge over the Menai Straits, the construction of which
has been intrusted by its well-known inventor to the very able
and experienced management of Mr. Frank Forster.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Chief Engineer.</span></h3>

<p>As the selection of an engineer-in-chief, competent to determine
the best line for a projected railway to take, the mode in
which it should be constructed, and, lastly, to execute his own
project—deviating from it with consummate judgment according
to the difficulties, physical, moral, and political, which, sometimes
separately and sometimes collectively, suddenly rise up to oppose
him—is a point not only of vital importance to the success of the
undertaking, but in the undertaking is the <em>first</em> important point
to be decided, it would, we were aware, have apparently been the
most regular to have commenced the present chapter with this
subject. We conceived, however, that instead of there detailing
the qualifications necessary for the duties required, it would save
us very many words, and our readers as much time, if we were
to defer the consideration of that subject until a brief outline of
those duties should, without comment, practically explain the
qualifications required.</p>

<p>If the United Kingdom had only projected the construction of
one or two great arterial railways, we might naturally have
expected that the few competent engineers necessary would
readily have been obtained; but when we consider the number
of railways that were simultaneously created, the surveys, plans,
sections, and other preparations that were necessary, the magnitude
of the works of various descriptions that were to be constructed
in each, it must evidently to many be a subject of
astonishment that there should have been found on the surface
of our country not only the amount of engineering talent necessary
for the execution of such vast works, but an amount which
may truly be said to have exceeded the demand.</p>

<p>The curious historical fact, however, is, that the amount of
engineering talent thus suddenly required existed not on <em>the
surface</em> of our country, but, on the contrary, many hundred fathoms
<em>beneath it</em>. The brilliant talents that were required were “black
diamonds,” without metaphor embedded in the bowels of the
earth. Science called her spirits from the vasty deep, and in
obedience to her commands there arose out of the shafts of our
coaleries, and from beneath the bottom of the <span class="lock">Thames—</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Old George Stephenson</span>, who had served his articles of
apprenticeship in a coal-mine, for many years working at the
engines both above ground and below;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Isambard Brunel</span>, whose principal experience had been
acquired in the construction of the Thames Tunnel;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Joseph Locke</span>, a colliery-viewer, who had served his apprenticeship
below ground;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Robert Stephenson</span>, brought up as a coal-miner, served his
apprenticeship at Killingworth colliery;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank Forster</span> had worked for seven years as an apprentice
in a coal-mine;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicholas Wood</span>, ditto;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles Lean</span>, ditto;</p>

<p>And a crowd of similar genii, all slaves of the same lamp, or
“<cite>Old Davy</cite>,” as they term it.</p>

<p>To such men the difficulties attendant upon the construction of
a railway were trifling as compared with those against which
all their lives they had been contending.</p>

<p>For instance, he who along dark, intricate, subterranean
passages, or “heavings,” as they are termed, often only three
feet and a half high, and occasionally only two feet high, creeping
and crawling through foul air, could with great speed, not
only with unerring certainty find his way, but in such a secluded
study could plan a variety of new cuttings, each forming part
and parcel of a reticulated system of excavation which an unpractised
mind would find it utterly impossible to comprehend,
would, it may easily be conceived, experience but little difficulty,
when walking erect in sunshine and in balmy air, to carry in his
mind from, say Harrow to Watford, Watford to Tring, Tring to
Wolverton, and Wolverton to Birmingham, those great leading
features of the surrounding country which would enable him
to exercise for the laying out of a railway the judgment and
decision required.</p>

<p>Again, what, it may justly be asked, are embankments, deep
cuttings, and occasionally here and there a straight tunnel thirty
feet broad, twenty-seven feet high, <em>usually forming by drainage
its own adit</em>, in comparison with the overwhelming and intricate
difficulties attendant <span class="lock">upon—</span></p>

<p>1st. The excavation of coal from strata of various characters,
at various depths, each passage or “air-heaving” requiring
perhaps a different system of support.</p>

<p>2nd. Encountering at various depths quicksands.</p>

<p>3rd. The great as well as minute arrangements necessary for
wheeling carriages and raising the coals.</p>

<p>4th. The organization and management of a subterranean
army of men and horses.</p>

<p>5th, and lastly. Lifting by steam-power from various depths,
by night and by day, streams, floods, and occasionally almost
rivers of water?</p>

<p>It has been beneath the surface of our country that these and
many other difficulties of vast magnitude—unknown to and
unthought of by the multitude—have for many generations been
successfully encountered by science, capital, and by almost superhuman
physical exertion; and it was accordingly, as we have
stated, from beneath the surface of Great Britain that an organised
corps of civil engineers, who, like those we have named,
had regularly served as apprentices, arose, in the emergency of a
moment, to assist their eminent brother engineers above ground,
in constructing for the country the innumerable railways so
suddenly required.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">On the Maintenance of the Permanent Way.</span></h3>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as an infant railway can run alone—we mean as soon
as its works are all constructed, its permanent way finished, its
buildings executed, its locomotive engines as well as its carriages
constructed, and its whole establishment of officers and men appointed
and organised—the chief engineer, like a month-nurse,
usually departs to new troubles, leaving the maintenance of the
way to those of his assistants whom he considers, and who in the
opinion of the Directors of the Company are deemed, the most
competent to execute its various details.</p>

<p>The manner in which this important duty is performed on the
London and North-Western Railway is very briefly as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<p>The line is, according to the nature of its works, divided into
distances of from 17 to 30 miles, to each of which there is
appointed “<em>an overlooker</em>,” whose district is subdivided into
“lengths” of one or two miles, to each of which is appointed
“<em>a foreman</em>,” with his gang of two or three men.</p>

<p>Every morning before the first train passes, the foreman is
required to walk over his length, not only generally to inspect
it, but especially to ascertain that each of the wooden keys which
secure the rails are firmly fixed; and in case of any deficiency,
his first operation is to put up, 800 yards above the point, a
signal flag, which flies until the necessary repair is executed.</p>

<p>The ambition of the superintendent of the division is, however,
to execute all necessary repairs not only with the utmost promptitude
and despatch, but, if possible, without impeding the passage
of the public; and considering the number of up and down passenger,
goods, and coal trains (vide ‘Bradshaw’s List’) that
are continually passing along the line, the success with which
this object can, in railway management, be practically attained
is worthy of explanation. For <span class="lock">instance—</span></p>

<p>1. In February, 1848, three miles of single rails were relaid
by the Company’s engineer in Kilsby Tunnel; 125 men and
one ballast-engine being employed in this work for four weeks,
without stopping the public.</p>

<p>2. The Beech Wood Tunnel (situated about five miles north
of Coventry, and about 300 yards in length) was entirely relined
with bricks. Two hundred workmen were employed in this
troublesome operation for about six weeks without a single
accident, and without stopping the public, who, indeed, probably,
during the whole period of the repair, passed through without
being even aware of the execution of the job.</p>

<p>3. Between June, 1845, and October, 1848, the Company’s
engineer of the Southern District relaid 57 miles of single line of
railway without stopping a train and without accident.</p>

<p>At the Agricultural Meeting at Northampton in July, 1847,
upwards of 11,000 persons were sent to Northampton, and
13,000 returned in the evening, the carriages they occupied
forming one mass as far as the eye could reach. From the Company’s
returns it appears that, of the above number, not a single
person received any injury; and although, from some unaccountable
reason, a good many of them on their return walked, it is
whispered, zigzaggedly, only two out of the whole number were
despatched to wrong destinations.</p>

<p>As the above facts require no comment, it is merely necessary to
explain by what description of arrangements the works of a great
railway can be repaired and renewed without stopping the public.</p>

<p>The two following specimens of the directions issued on such
occasions by the Company’s superintendent will best give the
information <span class="lock">required:—</span></p>

<span class="smcap">Relaying the Rails in the Kilsby Tunnel.</span><br>
</p>

<p>The Engineer Department have given notice that the workmen
are ready to commence removing the stone blocks and relaying the
rails in the Kilsby Tunnel.</p>

<p>The Electric Telegraph having been laid through the Tunnel, the
work is to commence on the night of Wednesday the 2nd of February,
and during its continuance the traffic is to be conveyed over one Line
from the passing of the Up Lancashire Express Train (say 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>)
until 8 o’clock the following morning, when the Up Line is to be clear
for the passage of the 7 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> Train from Birmingham.</p>

<p>The passage of the Trains through the Tunnel during the night is to
be under the following <span class="lock">regulations:—</span></p>

<p>The <em>Red</em> Signal is to be kept on at each entrance to the Tunnel
during the hours the traffic has to pass over the same Line; and every
Train, whether Up or Down, is to stop short of the Cross Road laid
down at the Tunnel mouth.</p>

<p>As a guide to the Drivers where to stop, a Post has been erected,
upon which a Red Light will be shown, and beyond which the Engine
is not to advance.</p>

<p>As a further precaution during the hours of relaying, the <em>Green</em>
Signal is to be shown at Crick, and by the Policeman stationed at
Hillmorton Ballast Pit, as notice to the Drivers in either direction to
shut off the steam.</p>

<p>On the approach of a Train to either entrance, the Policeman on
duty is to sound the Telegraph Bell, whereupon the Policeman at the
other end will respond by sounding his Bell; and immediately after
telegraph “<em>Line clear</em>,” or “<em>Line blocked</em>,” as the case may be.</p>

<p>If the answer be “<em>Line clear</em>,” the Train is to be allowed to enter
the Tunnel, the Policeman at the entrance telegraphing back to the
other end “<em>Train in</em>,” whereupon he will not again telegraph, or allow
any Engine to enter the Tunnel, until he receives Telegraph Notice
from the other end “<em>Train out</em>.”</p>

<p>The same process and precaution is to be observed with every Train
that may arrive, and no Signal is to be considered received and understood
until responded to.</p>

<p>Whichever end first rings the bell to announce the approach of a
Train, that Train is to have the precedence, and a Train arriving at the
other end is to be kept clear of the Crossing Points until the first
announced Train has passed, when, after telegraphing “<em>Train out</em>,”
and getting the response from the other end, the Policeman at that
end will ring his bell as notice that he has a Train waiting to enter,
which is to be allowed to proceed after passing the Signals as before
described.</p>

<p>Three Policemen are also to be stationed in the Tunnel, with Fog
Signals and Hand Lamps, to signal the Trains as they pass through;
and one additional at each entrance, to assist in the Signals and crossing
the Trains.</p>

<p>The Drivers are to be strictly enjoined to approach the Tunnel with
caution, as a Train may be standing outside, and on passing through
they are to be prepared to bring their Train to a stand, should it be
necessary to stop unexpectedly.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Trains—Euston.</span></h3>


<p class="center"><i>The Down Train.</i></p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> arriving in a cab at the Euston Station, the old-fashioned
traveller is at first disposed to be exceedingly pleased at the newborn
civility with which, the instant the vehicle stops, a porter,
opening its door with surprising alacrity, most obligingly takes out
every article of his luggage; but so soon as he suddenly finds out
that the officious green straight-buttoned-up official’s object has
been solely to get the cab off the premises, in order to allow the
string of variegated carriages that are slowly following to advance—in
short, that, while he has been paying to the driver,
say only two shining shillings, his favourite great-coat, his
umbrella, portmanteau, carpet-bag, Russia leather writing-case,
secured by Chubb’s patent lock, have all vanished—he poignantly
feels, like poor Johnson, that his “patron has encumbered him
with help;” and it having been the golden maxim of his life
never to lose sight of his luggage, it gravels and dyspepsias him
beyond description to be civilly told that on no account can he
be allowed to follow it, but that “<em>he will find it on the platform</em>;”
and truly enough the prophecy is fulfilled; for there he
does find it on a barrow in charge of the very harlequin who
whipped away, and who, as its guardian angel, hastily muttering
the words “<cite>Now then, Sir!</cite>” stands beckoning him to advance.</p>

<p>The picture of the departure of one of the large trains from
the Station at Euston Square, however often it may have been
witnessed, is worthy of a few moments’ contemplation.</p>

<p>On that great covered platform, which, with others adjoining
it, is lighted from above by 8797 square yards (upwards of an
acre and three-quarters) of plate-glass, are to be seen congregated
and moving to and fro in all directions, in a sort of Babel confusion,
persons of all countries, of all religions, and of all languages.
People of high character, of low character, of no
character at all. Infants just beginning life—old people just
ending it. Many desirous to be noticed—many, from innumerable
reasons, good, bad, and indifferent, anxious to escape notice.
Some are looking for their friends—some, suddenly turning upon
their heels, are evidently avoiding their acquaintance.</p>

<p>Contrasted with that variety of free and easy well-worn costumes
in which quiet-minded people usually travel, are occasionally
to be seen a young couple—each, like a new-born baby,
dressed from head to foot in everything perfectly new—hurrying
towards a coupé, on whose door there negligently hangs a black
board—upon which there is printed, not unappropriately, in
white bridal letters, the word “<span class="smcap">Engaged</span>.”</p>

<p>Across this mass of human beings a number of porters are to
be seen carrying and tortuously wheeling, in contrary directions,
baggage and property of all shapes and sizes. One is carrying
over his right shoulder a matted parcel, 12 or 15 feet long, of
young trees, which the owner, who has just purchased them for
his garden, is following with almost parental solicitude. Another
porter, leaning as well as walking backwards, is attempting with
his whole strength to drag towards the luggage-van a leash of
pointer-dogs, whose tails, like certain other “tails” that we
know of, are obstinately radiating from the couples that bind
together their heads: while a number of newspaper-vendors,
“fleet-footed Mercuries,” are worming their way through the
crowd.</p>

<p>Within the long and apparently endless straight line of railway
carriages which bound the platform, are soon seen the faces and
caps of various travellers, especially old ones, who with due precaution
have taken possession of their seats; and while most of
these, each of them with their newspapers unfolded on their
knees, are slowly wiping their spectacles, several of the younger
inmates are either talking to other idlers leaning on their carriage-windows,
or, half kissing and half waving their hands, are
bidding “farewell” to the kind friends who had accompanied
them to the station.</p>

<p>Some months ago, at a crisis similar to that just mentioned,
we happened to be ensconced in the far corner of a railway carriage,
when we heard a well-known clergyman from Brighton
suddenly observe to his next neighbour who sat between us,
“<cite>There must surely be something very remarkable in that scene!</cite>”
His friend, who was busily cutting open his <em>Record</em>, made no
reply, but, as we chanced to witness the trifling occurrence
alluded to, we will very briefly describe it. A young man of
about twenty-two, of very ordinary height, dress, and appearance,
was standing opposite to a first-class carriage just as the
driver’s whistle shrilly announced the immediate departure of
the train. At this signal, without any theatrical movement, or
affectation of any sort, he quietly reeled backwards upon a baggage-truck,
which happened to be immediately behind him.
Two elderly ladies beside him instantly set to work, first of all,
most vigorously to rub with their lean fingers the palms of his
hands—they might just as well have scrubbed the soles of his
boots;—then they untied his neckcloth; but their affectionate
kindness was of no avail. The train was probably separating
him from something, or from some one. The movement however
he had not witnessed, for the mere whistle of the engine
had caused him to swoon! What corresponding effect of fainting
or sobbing it may have produced on any inmate in that
carriage before which he had long been standing, and which had
just left him, we have no power to divine. It is impossible,
however, to help reflecting what a variety of emotions must every
day be excited within the train as well as on the platform at Euston
Station by the scream or parting whistle which we have just
described. From the murderer flying from the terrors of justice
down to the poor brokenhearted creditor absconding from his
misfortunes;—from our careworn Prime Minister down to the
most indolent member of either House of Parliament—each
simultaneously escaping after a long-protracted session;—from
people of all classes going from or to laborious occupation, down
to the schoolboy reluctantly returning to, or joyfully leaving, his
school;—from our Governor-General proceeding to embark for
India, down to the poor emigrant about to sail from the same
port to Australia—the railway-whistle, however unheeded by
the multitude, must oftentimes have excited a variety of feelings
which it would be utterly impossible to describe.</p>

<p>While the travellers of a train are peacefully taking their
seats, artillery-men, horses, and cannon, on a contiguous set of
rails, are occasionally as quietly embarking in carriages, horse-boxes,
and trucks, which are subsequently hooked on to a mass
of passengers perfectly unconscious of the elements of war which
are accompanying them.</p>

<p>As a departing railway-train, like a vessel sailing out of
harbour, proceeds on its course, its rate rapidly increases, until,
in a very short time, it has attained its full speed, and men of
business are then intently reading the “City news,” and men of
pleasure the leading article of their respective newspapers, when
this runaway street of passengers—men, women, and children—unexpectedly
find themselves in sudden darkness, visible only by
a feeble and hitherto unappreciated lamp, which, like the pale
moon after a fiery sunset, modestly shines over their head. By
this time the boarded platform at Euston Station, but a few
minutes ago so densely thronged with passengers, is completely
deserted. The lonely guard on duty, every footstep resounding
as he walks, paces along it like a sentinel. The newspaper-vendors,
sick unto death of the news they had been vaunting,
are indolently reclining at their stalls; even the boy who sells
‘Punch’ is half asleep; and there is nothing to break the sober
dulness of the scene but a few clerks and messengers, who, like
rabbits popping from one hole of their warren into another, enter
upon the platform from the door of one office to hurry into that
of the next. In a few minutes, however, the loud puffing of an
engine announces the approach towards the platform of a string
of empty carriages, which are scarcely formed into the next
departure train, when vehicles of all descriptions are again to be
seen in our most public thoroughfares concentrating upon the
focus of Euston Square; and thus, with a certain alleviation on
Sundays, this strange feverish admixture of confusion and quietness,
of society and solitude, continues intermittently from ¼ past
6 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> to 10 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> during every day in the week, every week in
the month, and every month in the year.</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Up Train.</i></p>

<p>The out-train having been despatched, we must now beg our
readers to be so good as to walk, or rather to scramble, with us
from the scene of its departure across five sets of rails, on which
are lying, like vessels at anchor in a harbour, crowds of railway-carriages
preparing to depart, to the opposite platform, in order
to witness the arrival of an incoming train. This platform, for
reasons which will shortly appear, is infinitely longer than that
for the departure trains. It is a curve 900 feet in length,
lighted by day from above with plate-glass, and at night by
67 large gas-lamps suspended from above, or affixed to the iron
pillars that support the metallic net-worked roof. Upon this
extensive platform scarcely a human being is now to be seen;
nevertheless along its whole length it is bounded on the off-side
by an interminable line of cabs, intermixed with private carriages
of all shapes, gigs, dog-carts, and omnibuses, the latter standing
opposite to little ugly black-faced projecting boards, which by
night as well as by day are always monotonously exclaiming,
“<cite>Holborn—Fleet Street—and Cheapside!</cite>”—“<cite>Oxford Street—Regent
Street—and Charing Cross!</cite>” <i>&amp;c.</i></p>

<p>In this motley range of vehicles, smart coachmen, tall pale
powdered footmen, and splendid horses are strangely contrasted
with the humble but infinitely faster conveyance—the common
cab. Most of the drivers of these useful machines, strange to
say, are absent; the remainder are either lolling on benches, or,
in various attitudes, dozing on their boxes. Their horses, which
are generally well-bred, and whose bent knees and fired hocks
proclaim the good services they have performed, stand ruminating
with a piece of sacking across their loins, or with nose-bags,
often empty—until for some reason a carriage before them
leaves their line: in which case, notwithstanding the absence of
their drivers and regardless of all noises, they quietly advance
along the edge of the little precipice which bounds the rails.
They there know quite well what they are waiting for, and have
no desire to move. Indeed, it is a Pickwickian fact, well known
to cab-drivers, that their horses travel unwillingly from the
station, but always pull hard coming back, simply because it is
during the waiting-time at Euston Station that their nose-bags
are put on—or, in other words, that they are fed.</p>

<p>We may here observe that there are sixty-five selected cabmen
who have the <i lang="fr">entrée</i> to the platform, and who, <i lang="la">quamdiù se
bene gesserint</i>, are allowed exclusively to work for the Company,
whose name is painted on their cabs. If more than these are
required, a porter calls them from a line of supplicant cabs
standing in the adjacent street. Close to each departure-gate
there is stationed a person whose duty it is to write down in a
book the number of each cabman carrying away a passenger, as
well as the place to which he is conveying him, which two facts
each driver is required to exclaim as he trots by; and thus any
traveller desirous to complain of a cabman, or who may have
left any property in a carriage from Euston Station, has only to
state on what day and by what train he arrived, also whither he
was conveyed, and from these data the driver’s name can at any
lapse of time be readily ascertained.</p>

<p>But our attention is suddenly claimed by something of infinitely
more importance than a passenger’s luggage: for that low
unearthly whine within the small signal-office behind the line of
cabs and carriages requires immediate explanation.</p>

<p>The variety of unforeseen accidents that might occur by the
unwelcome arrival of an unexpected or even of an expected
passenger-train at the great terminus of the London and North-Western
Railway are so obvious that it has been deemed necessary
to take the following precautions.</p>

<p>As soon as the reeking engine-funnel of an up-train is seen
darting out of the tunnel at Primrose Hill, one of the Company’s
servants stationed there, who deals solely in compressed air—or
rather, who has an hydraulic machine for condensing it—allows
a portion to rush through an inch iron pipe; and he thus instantaneously
produces in the little signal-office on the up-platform
of Euston Station, where there is always a signal-man watching
by night as well as by day, that loud melancholy whine which
has just arrested our attention, and which will continue to moan
uninterruptedly for five <span class="lock">minutes:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="la">
    <div class="verse indent12">“Hic vasto rex Æolus antro</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Luctantes ventos tempestatesque sonoras</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Imperio premit, ac vinclis et carcere frenat.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Illi indignantes magno cum murmure fremunt.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The moment this doleful intimation arrives, the signal-man,
emerging from his little office, touches the trigger of a bell
outside his door, which immediately in two loud hurried notes
announces to all whom it may concern the arrival at Camden
Station of the expected up-train; and at this moment it is interesting
to watch the poor cab-horses, who, by various small muscular
movements, which any one acquainted with horses can
readily interpret, clearly indicate that they are perfectly sensible
of what has just occurred, and quite as clearly foresee what will
very shortly happen to them.</p>

<p>As soon as the green signal-man has created this sensation
among bipeds and quadrupeds, taking with him the three flags,
of danger (red), caution (green), and security (white), he proceeds
down the line a few yards to a point from which he can
plainly see his brother signal-man stationed at the mouth of the
Euston tunnel. If any obstruction exists in that direction, the
waving of the red flag informs him of it; and it is not until the
white one from the tunnel as well as that from the station-master
on the platform have reported to him that “all is clear” that he
returns to his important but humble office (12 feet in length by
9 in breadth) to announce, by means of his compressed-air apparatus,
this intelligence to the ticket-collector at Camden Station,
whose strict orders are, on no account whatever to allow a train
to leave his platform until he has received through the air-pipes,
from the signal-office at Euston Station, the Company’s lugubrious
authority to do so.</p>

<p>In the latter office there are also the dial and wires of an
electric telegraph, at present inoperative. The signal-man, however,
mentioned to us the following trifling anecdote, as illustrative
of the practical utility of that wonderful invention, which
has so justly immortalized the names of Cooke and Wheatstone.
An old general officer, who, from his residence some miles beyond
Manchester, had come up to Euston Station on an invitation
from the East-India Directors to be present at the dinner to be
given by them to Lord Hardinge, found on his arrival that it
would be necessary he should appear in regimentals: and the
veteran, nothing daunted, was proposing to return to Manchester,
when the signal-man at Euston advised him to apply for them by
electric telegraph. He did so. The application, at the ordinary
rate of 280,000 miles (about twelve times the circumference of
the earth) <em>per second</em>, flew to Manchester; in obedience to its
commands a porter was instantly despatched into the country for
the clothes, which, being forwarded by the express train, arrived
in abundant time for the dinner. The charge for telegraph and
porter was 13<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr> 8<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr></p>

<p>About four minutes after the up-train has been authorised by
the air-pipe to leave Camden Station, the guard who stands
listening for it at the Euston tunnel, just as a deaf man puts his
ear to a trumpet, announces by his flag its immediate approach;
on which the signal-man at the little office on Euston platform
again touches his trigger, which violently convulsing his bell as
before, the cab-horses begin to move their feet, raise their jaded
heads, prick up their ears, and champ their bits; the servants in
livery turn their powdered heads round; the Company’s porters,
emerging from various points, quickly advance to their respective
stations; and this suspense continues until in a second or two
there is seen darting out of the tunnel, like a serpent from its
hole, the long dark-coloured dusty train, which, by a tortuous
movement, is apparently advancing at its full speed. But the
bank-riders, by applying their breaks—without which the engineless
train merely by its own gravity would have descended the
incline from Camden Station at the rate of forty miles an hour—soon
slacken its speed, until the Company’s porters at a brisk
walk are preparing to unfasten one after another the doors of
all the carriages.</p>

<p>While they are performing this popular duty, numerous salutations,
and kissings of hands of all colours and sizes, are seen to
pass between several of the inmates of the passing train and those
seated in or on the motley line of conveyances standing stock
still which have been awaiting their arrival. A wife suddenly
recognises her husband, a mother her four children, a sister her
two dear brothers; Lord A. B. politely bows to Lady C. D.;
John, from his remote coach-box, grins with honest joy as faithful
Susan glides by; while Sally bashfully smiles at “a gentleman”
in plush breeches reclining in the rumble of the barouche
behind it.</p>

<p>As soon as the train stops, a general “sauve qui peut” movement
takes place, and our readers have now an opportunity of
observing that, just as it is hard to <em>make</em> money, easy to spend it,
so, although it consumes at least twenty minutes to fill and
despatch a long train, it scarcely requires as many seconds to
empty one. Indeed, in less than that short space of time the
greater number of the railway carriages are often empty!</p>

<p>When every person has succeeded in liberating himself or
herself from the train, it is amusing to observe how cleverly,
from long practice, the Company’s porters understood the
apparent confusion which exists. To people wishing to embrace
their friends—to gentlemen and servants darting in various directions
straight across the platform to secure a cab or in search of
private carriages—they offer no assistance whatever, well knowing
that none is required. But to every passenger whom they
perceive to be either restlessly moving backwards and forwards,
or standing still, looking upwards in despair, they civilly say
“<cite>This way, Sir!</cite>” “<cite>Here it is, Ma’am!</cite>”—and thus, knowing
what they want before they ask, they conduct them either to the
particular carriage on whose roof their baggage has been placed,
or to the luggage-van in front of the train, from which it has
already been unloaded on to the platform; and thus, in a very
few minutes after the convulsive shaking of hands and the
feverish distribution of baggage have subdivided, all the cabs and
carriages have radiated away—the parti-coloured omnibuses have
followed them—even the horses, which in different clothing have
been disembarked, have been led or ridden away—and, the foot-passengers
having also disappeared, the long platform of the
incoming train of the Euston Station remains once more solely
occupied by one or two servants of the Company, hemmed in by
a new line of expectant cabs and omnibuses. Indeed, at various
periods of the day, a very few minutes only elapse before, at the
instigation of compressed air, the faithful signal-bell is again
heard hysterically announcing the arrival of another train at
Camden Station.</p>

<p>In a clear winter’s night the arrival of an up-train at the
platform before us forms a very interesting picture.</p>

<p>No sound is heard in the cold air but the hissing of a pilot
engine, which, like a restless spirit advancing and retrograding,
is stealing along the intermediate rails, waiting to carry off the
next down-train; its course being marked by white steam
meandering above it and by red-hot coals of different sizes which
are continually falling from beneath it. In this obscure scene
the Company’s interminable lines of gaslights (there are 232 at
the Euston Station), economically screwed down to the minimum
of existence, are feebly illuminating the damp varnished panels of
the line of carriages in waiting, the brass doorhandles of the
cabs, the shining haims, brass browbands and other ornaments on
the drooping heads and motionless backs of the cab-horses; and
while the blood-red signal lamp is glaring near the tunnel to
deter unauthorised intrusion, the stars of heaven cast a faint
silvery light through the long strips of plate-glass in the roof
above the platform. On a sudden is heard—the stranger hardly
knows whence—the mysterious moan of compressed air, followed
by the violent ringing of a bell. That instant every gaslight on
and above a curve of 900 feet suddenly bursts into full power.
The carriages, cabs, &amp;c. appear, comparatively speaking, in
broad daylight, and the beautiful iron reticulation which sustains
the glazed roof appears like fairy work.</p>

</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Railway Carriages.</span></h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> will now proceed to detail a few circumstances respecting
the railway carriages, about which our readers have probably
never cared to inquire.—And, <em>firstly</em>, as soon as an up-train
arrives at the commencement of the Euston platform, while it is
still in motion, and before its guard—distinguished by a silver-buckled
black shiny patent-leather belt, hanging diagonally across
the white buttons of his green uniform-coat—has ventured with
practised skill to spring from the sideboard of the train to the
platform, two greasy-faced men in canvas jackets, with an oil-can
in each of their right hands and with something like a mophead
of dirty cotton hugged under each of their left arms, are to be
seen running on each side of the rails below in pursuit of the
train; and while the porters, holding the handles of the carriage
doors, to prevent any traveller from escaping, are still advancing
at a brisk walk, these two oilmen, who have now overtaken the
train, diligently wipe as they proceed the dust and perspiration
from the buffer-rods of the last carriage. As soon as these irons
are perfectly clean and dry rubbed, they oil them from their can;
and then—crawling beneath the open doors of the carriages and
beneath the feet and ankles of a crowd of exuding travellers of
all ages, who care no more for oilmen than the oilmen of this
world care for them—they hurry to the buffer-rods of the next
carriage—and so rapidly do they proceed, that before the last
omnibus has driven off, the buffer-rods of the whole train are as
bright as when new. But, <em>secondly</em>, these two men have been
closely followed by two others in green jackets—one on each
side of the carriage—who deal solely in a yellow composition of
tallow and palm-oil. Carrying a wooden box full of this ointment
in one hand and a sort of short flat salve-knife in the other,
they open with the latter the small iron trap-doors which cover
the receptacles for greasing the axles, restore whatever quantity
has been exhausted, and then, closing with a dexterous snap the
little unctuous chamber over which they preside, they proceed to
the next tallow-box; and thus, while the buffer-rods of the whole
train are being comfortably cleaned and greased, the glistening
axles of the carriages are simultaneously fed with luxurious fat.
<em>Thirdly</em>, while these two operations are proceeding in the lower
region, at about the same rate two others are progressing, one
inside the carriages and the other on their roofs; for on the
arrival of every passenger-train, the carriage “<em>searcher</em>,” also
“beginning at the end,” enters every carriage, lifts up first all
the stuffed blue seats, next the carpet, which he drops in a heap
in the middle of the carriage, and then, inquisitively peeping
under the two seats, he leaves the carriage, laden with whatever
article or articles may have been left in it, to continue his search
throughout the train. The inconceivable number and variety of
the articles which he collects we shall shortly have occasion to
notice. <em>Fourthly</em>, above the searcher’s head, on the roof, and
following him very closely in his course, there “sits up aloft” a
man called a “<em>strapper</em>,” whose sole duty it is, on the arrival of
every train, to inspect, clean, shampoo, and refresh with cold-drawn
neat’s-foot oil the luggage-straps, which, in consequence
of several serious accidents that have occurred from their breaking,
are now lined inside with strong iron wire. It is the
especial duty of this inquisitor to condemn any straps that may
be faulty, in order that they may be immediately replaced.</p>

<p>As soon as these four simultaneous operations are concluded,
directions are given by the station-master to remove the up-carriages
from their position, that the rails may be clear for the
arrival of the next train. At this word of command a pilot-engine,
darting from its lurking place like a spider from its hole,
occasionally hisses up to the rear of the train, and drags it off
bodily into a siding. The usual mode, however, of getting an
in-train out of the way is by the assistance of various unnoticed
turn-tables, upon which portions of it are standing. By these
simple contrivances the carriages, after being unhooked from
each other, are rapidly carried off into the sidings, where they
are arranged, according as they may afterwards be required,
among the five sets of rails which lie between the opposite platforms
of the arrival and departure trains. No sooner, however,
do they reach this haven, than, <em>fifthly</em>, a large gang of strong he-housemaids,
clattering towards them in wooden shoes and in
leather leggings rising above their bony knees, are seen advancing;
some with mops in their hands, others with large chamois
leathers, while others are carrying on their shoulders a yoke, from
which are suspended <i lang="la">in equilibrio</i> two pails. From pipes on each
side of these five sets of rails water is immediately drawn off, and
the busy operation of washing then begins. Half a dozen dusty,
dirty-faced, or rather dirty-bodied, carriages are simultaneously
assailed on each of their sides by wet mops flying up, down, and
around in all directions. The wielders of these, be it noticed,
are so skilful in their vocation, that, while they are talking to
their “pailers,” they with great velocity continue to mop round
the wood-work of the various-shaped plate-glass windows just as
vigorously and as accurately as if they were looking at them;
indeed, it is evident that they know the position of railway-carriage
doors, windows of all forms, handles, steps, &amp;c., so
accurately, that they could mop a coach clean in the dark and
probably they often go through these motions when they are
asleep, just as King Richard <abbr title="Three">III.</abbr> in his dream called for his
horse and for linen bandages—just as the sleeping orator ejaculates
portions of his last speech—and just as an equally tired outstretched
fox-hound during the night occasionally convulsively
kicks with his uppermost hind leg and yelps aloud when he thinks
of the view he got of Renard as he first gallantly broke away
from —— gorse. It may possibly not be known to some of the
most fashionable of our readers that among “moppers” there
exist the same gradations which so distinctly separate other
classes of society. A “first-class mopper” would on no account
demean himself by mopping a second-class carriage, and in like
manner a “second-class mopper” only attains that distinction
after he has for a sufficient length of time been commissioned to
mop horse-boxes and common luggage-trains.</p>

<p>After the passenger-carriages are all washed and dried, they
are minutely examined, <em>sixthly</em>, by one or more of the foremen of
the coach department, who order off to their adjoining establishment
any that may require repair. Those that remain are then
visited, lastly, by “<em>the duster</em>,” who enters each carriage with a
cloth, a leather, a brush, and a dust-pan, with which apparatus
he cleans the windows, wipes the wood-work, brushes the blue
cloth seats, sides, and backs—and when this operation is concluded,
the carriages are reported fit to depart, and accordingly
are then marshalled into trains for that purpose.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Coach Department.</i></p>

<p>The new carriages for the southern division of the London and
North-Western Railway are principally built by contract in the
City by Mr. Wright, who also supplies carriages for other English
railways, as well as a great number for Germany. The Company’s
establishment at Euston Station, which is therefore principally
for the maintenance of carriages of various descriptions
running between London and Birmingham, consists of a large
area termed “the Field,” where, under a covering almost entirely
of plate-glass, are no less than fourteen sets of rails, upon which
wounded or spare carriages lie until doctored or required.
Immediately adjoining are various workshops, the largest of
which is 260 feet in length by 132 in breadth, roofed with plate-glass,
lighted by gas, and warmed by hot air. In this edifice, in
which there is a strong smell of varnish, and in the corner of
which we found men busily employed in grinding beautiful
colours, while others were emblazoning arms on panels, are to be
seen carriages highly finished as well as in different stages of
repair. Among the latter there stood a severely wounded second-class
carriage. Both its sides were in ruins, and its front had
been so effectively smashed that not a vestige of it remained.
The iron-work of the guard’s step was bent completely upwards,
and a tender behind was nearly filled with the confused <i lang="fr">débris</i> of
its splintered wood-work—and yet, strange to say, a man, his
wife, and their little child, who had been in this carriage during
its accident, had providentially sustained no injury! Close to
this immense warehouse we found a blacksmith’s shop seventy-five
feet square, lighted from the roof with plate-glass, containing
in the centre a large chimney, around which there were simultaneously
at work fourteen forges, blown by a steam-engine of
seventeen-horse power, which works machinery in two other
shops. As, however, we shall have occasion to describe the
Company’s coaching establishment at Crewe, we will abruptly
take leave of the details before us.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER <abbr title="Five">V.</abbr></h2>
</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Lost Luggage Office.</span></h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">At</span> a short distance from the terminus of the up-trains there is
a foundling-office, termed the Lost Luggage Office, in which are
received all articles which the passengers leave behind them,
and which on the arrival of every train are brought by the Company’s
“searcher” to this office. The superintendent on receiving
them records in a book a description of each article, stating
on what day, by what train, in what carriage it arrived, and by
whom found. All luggage bearing an address is kept about
forty-eight hours, and, if during that time no one calls for it, it
is then forwarded by rail or other conveyance to its owner. In
case it bears no address, if not inquired after, it is after a month
opened; and if any clue to the owner can be found within, a
letter is addressed to him. If no clue be found, the property is
kept about two years, and has hitherto been then sold by auction
in the large coach-factory to the Company’s servants—a portion
of the proceeds being handed over to the sick-fund for persons
who have been hurt in the service, and the remainder to “the
Friendly Society” among the men. It having, however, been
ascertained that a few of the Railway men who had spare cash
purchased the greater portion of these articles, it has, we understand,
very lately been determined henceforward to sell the
whole of this property by auction <em>exclusively to the public</em>; and
as the Company’s servants are not allowed to be purchasers, they
can no longer derive any benefit whatever from lost property,
which must often be of inestimable value to its owner, and which
they therefore should have no interest, direct or indirect, in concealing
from him.</p>

<p>A second ledger, entitled “<cite>Luggage Inquiry Book</cite>,” is kept
in this office, and, if the articles therein inquired after have not
been brought in by the searcher, copies of the description are
forwarded to each of the offices where lost luggage is kept; for,
by the Company’s orders, all luggage found between Wolverton
and London is without delay forwarded to the latter station, all
between Wolverton and Birmingham to Birmingham, and so on.</p>

<p>It is possible, however, that the above orders may not have
been attended to, and therefore, as a last resource, the superintendent
of the Lost Luggage Office at Euston Station applies
to the manager of the Railway Clearing House, who writes to
310 stations on forty-seven lines of rails to inquire after a lost
article, be it ever so small, and if it be at none of these stations a
letter is then addressed to the owner, informing him that his lost
property <em>is not on the railway</em>.</p>

<p>In the office in which these ledgers and letter-books are made
up are to be seen on shelves and in compartments the innumerable
articles which have been left in the trains during the last
two months, each being ticketed and numbered with a figure corresponding
with the entry-book in which the article is defined.
Without, however, describing in detail this property we will at
once proceed to a large pitch-dark subterranean vaulted chamber,
warmed by hot-air iron pipes, in which are deposited the flock of
lost sheep, or, without metaphor, the lost luggage of the last two

<p>Suspended from the roof there hangs horizontally in this
chamber a gas-pipe about eight feet along, and as soon as the
brilliant burners at each end were lighted the scene was really
astounding. It would be infinitely easier to say what there is
not, than what there is, in the forty compartments like great wine-bins
in which all this lost property is arranged. One is choke-full
of men’s hats, another of parasols, umbrellas, and sticks of
every possible description. One would think that all the ladies’
reticules on earth were deposited in a third. How many little
smelling-bottles—how many little embroidered pocket-handkerchiefs—how
many little musty eatables and comfortable drinkables—how
many little bills, important little notes, and other
very small secrets each may have contained, we felt that we would
not for the world have ascertained; but when we gazed at the
enormous quantity of red cloaks, red shawls, red tartan-plaids,
and red scarfs piled up in one corner, it was, we own, impossible
to help reflecting that surely English ladies of all ages who wear
red cloaks, &amp;c., must in some mysterious way or other be powerfully
affected by the whine of compressed air, by the sudden
ringing of a bell, by the sight of their friends—in short, by the
various conflicting emotions that disturb the human heart on
arriving at the up-terminus of the Euston Station; for else how,
we gravely asked ourselves, could we possibly account for the
extraordinary red heap before us?</p>

<p>Of course, in this Rolando-looking cave there were plenty of
carpet-bags, gun-cases, portmanteaus, writing-desks, books, bibles,
cigar-cases, &amp;c.; but there were a few articles that certainly we
were not prepared to meet with, and which but too clearly
proved that the extraordinary terminus-excitement which had
suddenly caused so many virtuous ladies to elope from their red
shawls—in short, to be all of a sudden not only in “a bustle”
behind, but all over—had equally affected men of all sorts and
conditions.</p>

<p>One gentleman had left behind him a pair of leather hunting-breeches!
another his boot-jack! A soldier of the 22nd regiment
had left his knapsack containing his kit! Another soldier of the
10th, poor fellow, had left his scarlet regimental coat! Some
cripple, probably overjoyed at the sight of his family, had left
behind him his crutches!! But what astonished us above all
was, that some honest Scotchman, probably in the extasy of
suddenly seeing among the crowd the face of his faithful <em>Jeanie</em>,
had actually left behind him the best portion of his bagpipes!!!</p>

<p>Some little time ago the superintendent, on breaking open,
previous to a general sale, a locked leather hat-box, which had
lain in this dungeon two years, found in it, under the hat, 65<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> in
Bank of England notes, with one or two private letters, which
enabled him to restore the money to the owner, who, it turned
out, had been so positive that he had left his hat-box at an hotel
at Birmingham that he had made no inquiry for it at the railway-office.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Parcel Delivery Office.</span></h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Besides</span> what is termed “the goods traffic,” or the conveyance
of heavy goods in luggage-trains, the London and North-Western
Railway Company have for some time undertaken to forward by
their passenger-trains, to the various stations on as well as beyond
their lines, light parcels, for the conveyance and delivery
of which, charges, of which the following are a sample, are
<span class="lock">made:—</span></p>

<p>The above charges include porterage and delivery of the
parcels. In London, however, the delivery is limited to within
three miles of the General Post-office, or say six miles from
Euston Square.</p>

<p>The mode in which the business of this department is conducted
at Euston Station is briefly as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<p>The superintendent of the department sits in an elevated
room, the sides of which being glazed enable him to look down
on his right and left into two offices, both of which communicate
on the south with the street by which parcels arrive from or
depart to various parts of the metropolis, and on the north side
with a branch railway leading into the main line. The floor of
one of these two offices is generally covered with baskets, brown-paper
parcels of all sizes, game, triangular boxes of wedding-cake,
and other articles, which have just arrived by rail from all
parts of England, Ireland, and Scotland; that of the other with
a multitude of parcels to be forwarded by rail to similar destinations.
In the daytime the down parcels are despatched from
the office in the break-waggons of various passenger-trains, and
the following locked-up vans laden with small parcels are also
forwarded every <span class="lock">night:—</span></p>

<p>The number of parcels thus conveyed to and from London and
the North amounted, in the year 1847, to 787,969, and in the
year 1848 to 774,464; of the latter number it appears that
only two were lost. The manner in which all these little parcels
are circulated throughout the country is as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<p>As soon as the empty railway vans arrive by the branch-rail
close to the north side of the parcels-office, a porter, who,
assisted by his comrades, has for some time previously been
arranging the parcels into heaps according to their respective
destinations, commencing with one set of them and rapidly taking
up parcel after parcel, exclaims in a loud monotonous tone, easily
enough set to music, inasmuch as it is exactly the middle note
of a stout porter’s voice, and which never varies for a moment
during the whole <span class="lock">operation—</span></p>

<p class="small">“Now <em>Leighton</em>.</p>
<div class="blockquot1">
<p class="unindent hanging small">“A paper for Hancock, of ——, light.</p>
<p class="unindent hanging small">“A basket for Wagstaff, of ——, out 8<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr>, light.</p>
<p class="unindent hanging small">“A box for Tomkins, of ——, weighs (he puts it into an index-scale at his right hand, and in about three seconds adds) 26 pounds.</p>
<p class="unindent hanging small">“A paper for Jones, of ——, out 4<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr></p>
</div>
<p class="small">“Now <em>Leamington</em>.</p>
<div class="blockquot1">
<p class="unindent hanging small">“A paper for S. on Avon (the porter never says <em>Stratford</em>) for ——, light,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>As fast as this chanting porter drawls out his facts the chief
clerk indelibly records them, convulsively snatching up at each
change of station the particular book of entry which belongs to
it. Another clerk at each exclamation hands over to a porter a
bill for the cost of conveyance, which he pastes to every parcel.
For all articles declared by the first porter to be “<em>light</em>,” by
which he means that they do not exceed twelve pounds weight—(by
far the greater number are of this description)—the charge on
the paper to be affixed is ready printed, which effectually prevents
fraud; but where the weight <em>exceeds</em> twelve pounds, or where
any sum has been paid out, the charges are unavoidably inserted
in ink. The velocity with which all these little parcels are
booked, weigh-billed, placed into hand-trucks, wheeled off to
their respective vans, packed, locked up, and then despatched
down the little branch-rail to the main line, on which is the
train ready to convey them, is very surprising. While witnessing
the operation, however, we could not help observing that the
Company’s porters took about as much notice of the words
“Keep this side uppermost,” “With care,” “Glass,” “To be
kept very dry,” &amp;c., as the Admiralty would to an intimation
from some dowager-duchess that her nephew, who is about to
join the Thunderer as a midshipman, “has rather <em>a peculiar
constitution</em>, and will therefore require for some years <em>very particular</em>
<span class="allsmcap">CARE</span>.”</p>

<p>During Christmas week the number of railway parcels that
flow into and ebb out of London is so enormous, that extra
accommodation, as well as preparations, are necessary for their
reception and despatch; and as we chanced to arrive from the
country at Euston Station on Saturday the 23rd of December
last, we will endeavour briefly to describe the scenes which for
a very few minutes we stopped to witness.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the space usually allowed for the
disembarkation of the passengers arriving by the up-trains had
been cut off by a lofty partition, or, as it is now-a-days termed,
a barricade, behind which, instead of red republicans armed
with loaded muskets, we were exceedingly happy to find nothing
but phalanxes, solid squares, columns, and pyramids of small
parcels, the destinations of which in large letters were chalked
on consecutive compartments of the north wall of the Euston
territory, as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Over the Water.</span>” <span class="ss" style="width:5em">&thinsp;</span> “<span class="smcap">Finsbury.</span>”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="justl">“<span class="smcap">Strand.</span>”</span> “<span class="smcap">Squares.</span>” <span class="justr">“<span class="smcap">Clerkenwell.</span>”</span></p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Islington.</span>” <span class="ss" style="width:5em">&thinsp;</span> “<span class="smcap">Kingsland.</span>”</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Camden Town.</span>”</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">City.</span>” <span class="ss" style="width:5em">&thinsp;</span> “<span class="smcap">West End.</span>”</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Westminster.</span>”</p>

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Pimlico.</span>”</p>

<p>As soon as we had rapidly glanced over the tarpaulin-covered-in
arrangements above described, which had been made for the
reception of parcels <em>for</em> London, we hurried across the five
sets of rails that separate the platforms of the in and out trains
to the “Parcels Delivery Office,” both departments of which
we found had been exclusively devoted for the week to the reception
and despatch of parcels <em>from</em> London to the country.
On the floor of each of the offices we have already described we
saw piled to a considerable height masses of parcels, which it
was evident could scarcely be despatched as rapidly as they were
arriving. The clerks, the assistants, as well as the extra persons
who had been engaged, all appeared more or less exhausted.
The accountant—the recording angel of the establishment—looked
deadly pale, while the voices of the chanting porters
were, to a pitiable degree, weaker and fainter than when we had
last heard them; indeed, the whole establishment had evidently
been overwhelmed with parcels which the Company’s servants
were still collecting, receiving, lifting, driving, wheeling,
turning, twisting, weighing, pasting, labelling, and hallooing at,
and yet, notwithstanding the rapidity with which they were
despatched by rails, vans, waggons, carts, and busses, they
were arriving, if possible, faster than ever!</p>

<p>Now, after this afflicting description of the plague of parcels
which during Christmas week annually infests and infects the
Euston Station, our readers will, no doubt, feel somewhat alarmed
when we state that we propose to inform them in detail of the
contents of each!</p>

<p>The job, however, is easily performed, for in these parcels
there are neither gold, silver, jewels, pictures, nor books—they
contain neither covering for the body nor consolation for the
mind—they belong neither to the vegetable nor to the mineral
kingdom—in short, they are simply composed of good, plain,
honest eatables, bequeathed by British hearts, addressed by
British hands to British stomachs of all classes of society.</p>

<p>But as our arterial blood is of one colour, while that which
returns through our veins is of another, so is there a most remarkable
difference in the character of these flowing and ebbing
parcels: all those which have come <em>into</em> London being either deceased
turkeys or game, while the outgoing or outward-bound
parcels are, with scarcely an exception, composed of barrels of
live oysters, several of which are accompanied by a good heavy
basket of fish. The number of barrels thus despatched from
Euston Station within twenty-four hours amounted to 5009, and,
as a hundred oysters are usually packed in each barrel, it is
strange to think of half a million of “natives” leaving London
in one day for the express purpose of wishing “a merry Christmas
and a happy new year” to those whose hares, pheasants, partridges,
rabbits, turkeys, and chickens have inanimately come to
the metropolis on the very same day on the very same errand!
To the above “bills of fare” we may add, that during last
Christmas week no less than 450 waggons of live cattle arrived
at Camden Station within the space of twenty-four hours.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The Locomotive Engine.—Camden.</span></h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Considering</span> how many fine feelings and good feelings adorn
the interior of the human heart, it is curious to observe with what
facility we can put them all to sleep, or, if they won’t sleep,
stupify ourselves, at any moment when it becomes inconvenient
to us to listen to their friendly admonitions. All the while mailing,
coaching, and posting were in fashion, every man’s countenance
beamed—every person’s tongue gabbled freely as it described
not only “<em>the splendid rate</em>” (say ten miles an hour) at
which he had travelled, but the celerity with which no sooner had
the words “<cite>First turn-out!</cite>” been exclaimed by the scout, who
vanished as soon as he had uttered them, than four horses in
shining harness had appeared half hobbling half trotting from
under the archway of the Red Lion, the Crown, or the Three
Bells, before which the traveller had from a canter been almost
suddenly pulled up, to receive various bows, scrapes, and curtsies
from the landlord and his rosy-faced cap-beribboned wife. But,
although we could all accurately describe our own enjoyments,
and, like Johnson, expatiate on “the delightful sensations” we experienced
in what we called <em>fast travelling</em>, who among us ever
cared to ascertain, or even for a single moment to think of, the
various arrangements necessary for watering, feeding, cleaning,
and shoulder-healing all the poor horses whose “brilliant” performances
we had so much admired? Whether they slept on
straw or on stones—indeed, whether they slept at all—what was
their diet—what, if any, were their enjoyments—what were their
sufferings—and, lastly, how and where they eventually died—it
would have been deemed exceedingly vulgar to inquire; and so,
after with palpitating flanks and panting nostrils they had once
been unhooked from our splinter-bars,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Where they went, and how they fared,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No man knew, and no man cared!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a similar way we now chloroform all kindly feelings of inquiry
respecting the treatment of the poor engine-drivers, firemen,
and even of the engine that has safely conveyed us through
tunnels and through storms at the rate of thirty, forty, and occasionally
even fifty miles an <span class="lock">hour—</span></p>

<p class="center small">
“Oh no! we never mention them!”<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent">and in fact scarcely do we deign to look at them. Indeed even
while in the train, and most especially after we had left it, we
should feel bored to death by being asked to reflect for a moment
on any point or any person connected with it. We have therefore,
we feel, to apologise at least to some of our readers for
intruding upon them, in bringing “betwixt the wind and their
nobility” the following uninteresting details.</p>

<p>As soon as an engine has safely dragged a passenger-train to
the top of the incline at Camden Station, at which point the
coupling-chains which connect it with its load are instantly unhooked,
it is enabled by the switchman to get from the main line
upon a pair of almost parallel side rails, along which, while the
tickets are being collected, it may be seen and heard retrograding
and hissing past its train. After a difficult and intricate passage
from one set of rails to another, advancing or “shunting” backwards
as occasion may require, it proceeds to the fire-pit, over
which it stops. The fireman here opens the door of his furnace,
which by a very curious process is made to void the red-hot contents
of its stomach into the pit purposely constructed to receive
them, where the fire is instantly extinguished by cold water ready
laid on by the side. Before, however, dropping their fire, the
drivers are directed occasionally to blow off their steam to clean;
and we may further add that once a-week the boiler of every
engine is washed out to get rid of sediment or scale, the operation
being registered in a book kept in the office. After dropping
his fire, the driver, carefully taking his fire-bars with him,
conducts his engine into an immense shed or engine-stable 400
feet in length by 90 in breadth, generally half full of locomotives,
where he examines it all over, reporting in a book what
repairs are wanting, or, if none (which is not often the case), he
reports it “<em>correct</em>.” He then takes his lamps to the lamp-house
to be cleaned and trimmed by workmen solely employed to do so,
after which he fetches them away himself. Being now off duty,
he and his satellite fireman go either to their homes or to a sort
of club-room containing a fire to keep them warm, a series of
cupboards to hold their clothes, and wooden benches on which
they may sit, sleep, or ruminate until their services are again required;
and here it is pleasing to see these fine fellows in various
attitudes enjoying rest and stillness after the incessant noise, excitement,
and occasional tempests of wind and rain, to which—we
will say nothing of greater dangers—they have been exposed.</p>

<p>The duties which the engine-driver has to perform are not only
of vital importance, but of a nature which peculiarly illustrates
the calm, unpretending, bull-dog courage, indigenous to the
moist healthy climate of the British Isles. Even in bright sunshine,
to stand—like the figure-head of a ship—foremost on a
train of enormous weight, which, with fearful momentum, is rushing
forward faster than any race-horse can gallop, requires a cool
head and a calm heart; but to proceed at this pace in dark or
foggy weather into tunnels, along embankments, and through
deep cuttings, where it is impossible to foresee any obstruction,
is an amount of responsibility which scarcely any other situation
in life can exceed; for not only is a driver severely, and occasionally
without mercy, punished for any negligence he himself
may commit, but he is invariably sentenced personally to suffer
on the spot for any accident that from the negligence of others
may suddenly befall the road along which he travels, but over
which he has not the smallest control. The greatest hardship he
has to endure, however, is from cold, especially that produced in
winter by evaporation from his drenched clothes passing rapidly
through the air. Indeed, when a gale of wind and rain from the
north-west, triumphantly sweeping over the surface of the earth
at its ordinary rate of say sixty miles an hour, suddenly meets the
driver of the London and North-Western, who has not only to
withstand such an antagonist, but to dash through him, and in
spite of him to proceed in an opposite direction at the rate of say
forty miles an hour—the conflict between the wet Englishman
and Æolus, tilting by each other at the combined speed of a hundred
miles an hour, forms a tournament of extraordinary interest.</p>

<p>As the engine is proceeding, the driver, who has not very many
inches of standing-room, remains upon its narrow platform, while
his fireman, on about the same space, stands close beside him on
the tender. We tried the position. Everything, however, proved
to be so hard, excepting the engine, which was both hard and
hot, that we found it necessary to travel with one foot on the tender
and the other on the engine, and, as the motion of each was
very different, we felt as if each leg were galloping at a different
stride. Nevertheless the Company’s drivers and firemen usually
travel from 100 to 120 miles per day, performing six of these
trips per week; nay, a few run 166 miles per day—for which
they are paid eight days’ wages for six trips.</p>

<p>But to return to the engine which we just left in the engine-house.
As soon as the driver has carefully examined it, and has
recorded in a book the report we have described, the “foreman of
the fitters” comes to it, and examines it all over again; and if
anything is found out of order which, on reference to the book,
the driver has not reported, the latter is reported by the former
for his negligence. A third examination is made by Mr. Walker,
the chief superintending engineer of the station, a highly intelligent
and valuable servant of the Company, who has charge of the
repairs of the locomotive department between Camden and Tring.
If <span class="allsmcap">HE</span> detects any defect that has escaped the notice not only of the
driver, but of the foreman of the fitters, woe betide them both!</p>

<p>While the engine, with several workmen screwing and hammering
at it, is undergoing the necessary repairs, we will consider
for a moment a subject to which Englishmen always attach considerable
importance, namely, its victuals and drink, or, in other
words, its coke and water. There is at Camden Station a coke-factory
composed of eighteen ovens, nine on each side, in which
coal after being burnt for about fifty hours gives nearly two-thirds
of its quantity of coke. These ovens produce about 20 tons of
coke per day; but, as 50 tons per day are required for the
Camden Station alone, the remaining 30 tons are brought by rail
all the way from Newcastle. Indeed, with the exception of fifty
ovens at Peterborough, the whole of the coke required annually for
the London and North-Western Railway, amounting to 112,500
tons, of an average value of 1<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> per ton, comes from the Northern
Coal-fields. For some time there were continual quarrels between
the coke suppliers and receivers, the former declaring that
the Company’s waggons had been despatched from the North as
soon as loaded, and the latter complaining that they had been
unnecessarily delayed. A robin-redbreast settled the dispute,
for, on unloading one of the waggons immediately on its arrival
at Camden Station, her tiny nest with three eggs in it minutely
explained that the waggon had <em>not</em> been despatched as soon as
loaded.</p>

<p>In order to obtain an ample supply of water for their engines,
the Company at considerable expense sank at Camden an Artesian
well 10 feet in diameter and 140 feet deep. The produce
of this well, pumped by a high-pressure steam-engine of 27-horsepower
into two immense cisterns 110 feet above the rails at
Euston Square, supplies all the Camden Station, all the Company’s
houses adjoining, the whole of the Euston Station, as well
as the Victoria and Euston Hotels, with most beautiful clear
water; and yet—though every man who drinks it or who shaves
with it admires it, and though every lady who makes tea with it
certifies that it is particularly well adapted for that purpose—strange
to say, it disagrees so dreadfully with the stomachs of the
locomotive engines—(who would ever suspect <em>them</em> to be more
delicate than our own?)—that the Company have been obliged,
at great inconvenience and cost, to obtain water for them elsewhere.
The boilers of the locomotives were not only chemically
liable to be incrusted with a deposition of the unusual quantity
of soda contained in the Artesian-well water at Camden Station;
but, not even waiting for this inconvenience, the engine without
metaphor spit it out—ejecting it from the boiler with the steam
through the funnel-pipe, a well-known misfortune termed by
engineers “<em>priming</em>.”</p>

<p>As much time would be required for each travelling engine to
get up its steam <i lang="la">ab initio</i>, a coke-furnace has been constructed at
Camden Station to hasten the operation. Here nine men during
the day, and the same number throughout the night, are continually
employed to heat coke, which by means of iron shovels
is to be delivered red-hot into the engines’ furnaces.</p>

<p>These preparations having been made, the driver’s duties are
as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<p>On leaving the shed in the morning the engine, after having
been heated at the coke-furnace, is conducted on to a great turn-table
40 feet in diameter, which twists it towards a set of rails
leading to the water-crane, where it imbibes at one draught about
a thousand gallons of cold water, which, under ordinary circumstances,
will enable it to draw its train about 40 miles; although
in slippery weather, when the wheels revolve <em>on</em>, instead of <em>along</em>,
the rails, it of course would not carry it so far. It then proceeds
to the coke-shed, an enclosure 210 feet by 45 feet, capable of
holding 1500 tons, for its proper supply of coke, namely, 1 ton—a
goods-engine usually devouring 2½ tons.</p>

<p>The driver, leaving his engine in charge of his fireman, now
proceeds to the office, where he signs his name in a book, the
object being that it may be observed whether or not he is perfectly
sober. From the chief clerk he receives his coke and time
ticket, upon which, at every station, he has to record whatever
time he may have lost up to that point; and when his chronometer
is wound up, and set to the proper time, he is then considered
to be ready for his journey.</p>

<p>The gigantic power of the locomotive engines hourly committed
to the charge of these drivers was lately strangely exemplified
in the large engine-stable at the Camden Station. A passenger-engine,
whose furnace-fire had but shortly been lighted, was
standing in this huge building surrounded by a number of
artificers, who, in presence of the chief superintendent, were
working in various directions around it. While they were all
busily occupied, the fire in the furnace, by burning up faster
than was expected, suddenly imparted to the engine the breath
of life; and no sooner had the minimum of steam necessary to
move it been thus created, than this infant Hercules not only
walked <em>off</em>, but without the smallest embarrassment walked
<em>through</em> the 14-inch brick wall of the great building which contained
it, to the terror of the superintendent and workmen, who
expected every instant that the roof above their heads would fall
in and extinguish them! In consequence of the spindle of the
regulator having got out of its socket, the very same accident
occurred shortly afterwards with another engine, which, in like
manner, walked through another portion of this 14-inch wall of
the stable that contained it, just as a thorough-bred horse would
have walked out of the door. And if such be the irresistible
power of the locomotive engine when feebly walking in its newborn
state, unattended or unassisted even by its tender, is it not
appalling to reflect what must be its momentum when, in the full
vigour of its life, it is flying down a steep gradient at the rate
of 50 miles an hour, backed up by say 30 passenger-carriages,
each weighing on an average 5½ tons? If ordinary houses could
suddenly be placed on its path, it would, passengers and all,
run through them as a musket-ball goes through a keg of butter;
but what would be the result if, at this full speed, the engine
by any accident were to be diverted against a mass of solid rock,
such as sometimes is to be seen at the entrance of a tunnel, it is
almost impossible to calculate, or even to conjecture. It is stated
by the Company’s superintendent, who witnessed the occurrence,
that some time ago, an ordinary accident happening to a luggage-train
near Loughborough, the waggons overrode each other
until the uppermost one was found piled 40 feet above the rails!</p>

<p>At Camden Station there are every day five spare or pilot
engines, with their steam up, ready for assisting a train up the
incline, or for any special purposes that may be required.</p>

<p>The average cost of the locomotive engines and tenders, which,
for the rails between London and Birmingham, are usually purchased
by the Company from makers at Manchester, Warrington,
and Liverpool, <span class="lock">is—</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Goods Department.</span></h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> duties of this department, which forms one of the most
important establishments at Camden Station, may very briefly be
elucidated. It appears from returns lying before us, that during
the six months ending the 26th of August last there entered and
departed from Camden Station alone 73,732 railway waggon-loads
of goods! Now in the annals of political economy there
can perhaps scarcely exist a more striking exemplification of the
extraordinary extent to which the latent resources of a great
country may be developed by diminishing the friction, or, without
metaphor, by lowering the tolls of its goods-traffic, than the fact
that, notwithstanding the enormous amount thus conveyed along
the London and North Western rails, the quantity carried along
the Grand Junction Canal, which meanders alongside its powerful
antagonist, instead of having been drained, as might have
been expected, to zero, has, from the opening of the railway in
1836 up to the present period, actually increased as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

</table>

<p>Besides the innumerable arrangements necessary for the conveyance
along their rails of the number of waggon-loads of goods we
have stated, the Company undertake the vexatious and intricate
business of collecting and delivering these goods from and to all
parts of London, as also throughout the various towns on their
line, excepting Liverpool, where the collection and delivery of
goods is otherwise arranged. The number of letters on business
received by the branch of this department at Camden Station only,
averages 300 per day.</p>

<p>For the collection, loading, unloading, and delivery of a
certain portion of the merchandise conveyed by the Company
on their rails, the Board of Directors have, we think with great
prudence, availed themselves of the practical knowledge and
experience of Messrs. Pickford and of Messrs. Chaplin and
Horne, whom they have engaged as their agents at Camden
Station—the Company’s superintendent there marshalling and
despatching all luggage-trains, arranging the signals, and
making out the weigh-bills, &amp;c. The undertaking is one of
enormous magnitude; for besides immense cargoes of goods in
large packages, an inconceivable number of small parcels are
sent from Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Sheffield, &amp;c. to numberless
little retail shopkeepers in London, who are constantly
requiring, say a few saucepans, kettles, cutlery, &amp;c.; and when
it is considered that for the collection, conveyance, and delivery
of most of these light parcels 1<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr> only is charged, and, moreover,
that for the conveyance of a small parcel by the Company’s
goods-trains from say Watford to Camden Station, to be there
unloaded into store, thence reloaded into and transported by a
spring waggon to almost any street and house in London, or to
the terminus of any railway-station to which it may be addressed,
the charge is only 6<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr>, it is evident that a great deal of attention
and skill are necessary to squeeze a profit from charges which
competition has reduced to so low a figure.</p>

<p>At, and for some time after, the commencement of railway
traffic, it was considered dangerous to convey goods by night.
They are now, however, despatched from Birmingham at 8·45 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>,
to arrive at Camden Station at 3½ in the morning. Goods from
London are despatched at 9 in the evening, at midnight, at 12½,
at ¼ before 1, at 3, and at 5 in the morning. In the day they
are despatched at 12·40, at 1·15, at 2·6, and at 6½; and such
regularity is attained, that packs of cotton, linen, and woollen
goods from Manchester are usually delivered in London almost
with the regularity of letters. An immense quantity of fish from
Billingsgate, and occasionally as much as 20 tons of fruit from
Covent Garden market, are injected into the country by the
midday train: indeed the London wholesale dealers in these
articles do not now fear receiving too great a supply, as, whatever
may be their surplus, the railway is ready to carry it off to the
manufacturing districts—Manchester alone swallowing almost any
quantity; besides which, large quantities of fruit are conveyed
by rail as far as Glasgow. Many tons of meat in hampers, and
oftentimes a flock of a hundred dead sheep, wrapped up only
in cloths, are also despatched from the country to the London
market.</p>

<p>Without tiring our readers with minute details, the following
is a rough outline of the mode in which the goods-traffic is conducted.</p>

<p>As soon as an up luggage-train arrives at Camden Station, its
loaded waggons of merchandise, which are placed under the care
of the Goods-department Superintendent as soon as they arrive,
are, under his directions, drawn by horses along a variety of
branch-rails to a certain point, where they are left by the superintendent
in the open air, from which moment Messrs. Pickford
and Messrs. Chaplin and Horne—to whom the different waggons
are respectively addressed, and between whom a wholesome
competition exists, highly advantageous to the public—are held
responsible by the Company for fire or accident of any sort; in
short, for their safe delivery. The waggons thus deposited by
the superintendent, solely under the canopy of heaven, are instantly
approached by drivers and horses belonging to the two
competing agents, who with great cleverness, by repeatedly
twisting them on turn-tables, and then by drawing them along
an apparent labyrinth of rails, conduct each species of goods
to its own store, where, by experienced porters, it is immediately
unloaded and despatched by spring waggons to its destination.</p>

<p>As regards the down-trade, the business transacted in this
department, although apparently complicated, is very admirably
arranged. The spring waggons and carts of the Company’s
agents, like bees in search of honey, with extraordinary intelligence
migrate in all directions to the various localities of the
metropolis in search, piecemeal, of that enormous traffic, large
and small, which by every diurnal pulsation of the heart of
London is projected into our manufacturing districts, which in
return send back to the metropolis very nearly the same amount.
Every waggon-load of merchandise thus obtained, as well as
every boat-load of goods (for the Company have also at Camden
Station a branch water-communication leading into the Regent’s
Canal), is either carted at once to the particular storehouse to
which it belongs, to be thence reloaded into railway vans, or it
is brought to “<em>The General Receiving Shed</em>” either of Messrs.
Pickford, or of Messrs. Chaplin and Horne; and to prevent
mistakes, all invoice-forms and truck-labels for the former firm
are printed in black, those for the latter in red. In these enormous
receptacles goods “<em>coming in</em>” are arranged on one side,
those “<em>going out</em>” on the other. In Messrs. Pickford’s receiving
shed, which is 300 feet in length by 217 in breadth, there are
in operation, for the purpose of rapidly loading and unloading
<span class="lock">goods—</span></p>

<ul>
<li>24 steam-cranes,</li>
<li>21 wooden cranes,</li>
<li>&ensp;1 steam-doller or lift,</li>
<li>&ensp;1 travelling-crane on the roof,</li>
<li>&ensp;1 steam-capstan for hauling trucks along rails to the various loading bays.</li>
</ul>

<p>We observed also at work 4 steam hay-cutters, which cut
200 trusses in four hours, and 1 steam hay-cleaner. The above
machines are worked simultaneously by an engine of 16-horse
power, which also raises from an Artesian well, 380 feet deep,
water, which is given warm to 222 horses in adjoining stables.
These horses are all named, and branded with a number on their
hoofs.</p>

<p>In the general receiving-shed of Messrs. Chaplin and Horne
there are also a series of cranes, with large stables full of horses
that work about twelve hours a-day; the “Weights of Goods
allowed to be taken by them in each Vehicle” being as

<p>By the very great powers committed by the Company to their
two agents, 50 waggon-loads of merchandise, collected and
brought by spring-waggons to Camden Station, have often,
within two hours, been despatched by the superintendent to the
manufacturing districts. During the day, as fast as the spring-waggons
arrive their contents are unloaded, and either left on the
covered platform of the building or ranged around the walls in
large compartments, labelled “Glasgow,” “Birmingham,” “Manchester,”
“Leicester,” “Nottingham,” “Coventry,” &amp;c.; and as
on the great square of Valetta at Malta one sees congregated the
costumes of almost every merchant upon earth, so do these
receiving-sheds display goods and chattels of almost every description.
Here lies a waggon-load of beer from Chester,—there
another of sugar-loaves, in blue paper, for Northampton,—of
groceries for Buckingham,—cheeses, millinery, and gas-pipes for
Peterborough,—a vanload of empty hosiery skips (baskets) to
return to Leicester,—empties for Glasgow,—filberts for Birmingham,
&amp;c.: and as the goods are coming in as fast as they
are going out, the colours of this kaleidoscopic scene are constantly
changing. Indeed, during the short time we were
ruminating on the strange chance-medley of objects before us,
fourteen truck-loads of goods were unladen, and eight spring-waggons
loaded and despatched.</p>

<p>The amount of business transacted in each of these great receiving-sheds
every evening, from seven till about ten o’clock, is
quite astonishing. On Messrs. Pickford’s great elevated platform,
which at that time is laden with goods of all descriptions, several
clerks, each protected by a sort of rough arbour of iron rods,
and lighted by gas, are seen, in various localities, sitting before
little desks, towards which porters from all directions are wheeling,
on trucks, different articles which have just been unloaded
from a series of spring-vans, the bottoms of which are nearly on
a level with the platform. The drivers of these carriages, entering
the building at a large gate, twist, turn, and then back their
horses with a dexterity which an unpractised person would think
it impossible for men and horses to attain: “<cite>Now then!</cite>” and
“<cite>All right!</cite>” being almost the only vociferations to be heard.
As fast as the goods can be unladen from the spring-waggons to
the platform, a porter lustily calls out the address on each bale
or parcel, which is actively registered by a clerk. These invoices
are then briskly sent across to the other side of the
platform, in order that each article enumerated therein, when
reloaded—as it almost immediately is, into railway waggons—may
be ticketed off, to ascertain whether every package taken in
at the receiving side of the platform has <i lang="la">bonâ fide</i> been safely
despatched from the other.</p>

<p>Until the visitor to this extraordinary nocturnal scene has had
some time first to recover his composure, and then to observe,
analyse, and reflect on the various arrangements simultaneously in
operation before him, the picture altogether is really astounding.
For from one side of the platform a set of active porters are centripedally
wheeling from different spring-waggons innumerable
packages to the recording clerks, as eagerly as from these clerks
(whose duty it is to record the weight of every article, and to
affix to it the Company’s printed charge for conveyance to its
address) other porters, equally active, are centrifugally wheeling
other packages to various railway vans, which, as fast as they
can be filled, are drawn away from the despatching side of the
platform, and immediately replaced by empty ones. One set of
porters are wheeling to a recording clerk a waggon-load of raw
silk, valued at 9000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>, from China, which, <i>viâ</i> the South-Western
Railway, has just arrived from Southampton to go to Macclesfield
to be manufactured; another set, Russia tallow, in casks;
others, draperies; another set, yarns for Gloucester; one porter
has on his truck a very small but heavy load of iron or lead;
another, with comparative ease, is wheeling through the crowd
a huge wool-bag, large enough to contain, if properly packed, a
special jury. Here comes a truck of mustard, in small casks,
followed by another full of coffee; there goes a barrow-load of
drugs—preceding a cask of spirits, which, to prevent fraud, has
just been weighed, tapped, gauged, and sampled; also several
trucks full of household furniture; the family warming-pan
being tacked round the body of the eight-day clock, &amp;c. This
extraordinary whirl of business, set to music by the various
noises proceeding from the working of the steam-cranes, steam-doller,
steam-capstan, common cranes, and other machinery
above the platform—from the arrival, turning, backing, and
departure of spring-waggons beneath it—from the rumbling of
porters’ trucks crossing the platform, as also of the railway vans
as, laden with goods, they are successively rolled away—forms
altogether, we repeat, a scene which, though rarely visited, is
astounding to witness, and which, we are sensible, we have but
very faintly described.</p>

<p>But, besides the amount of business above mentioned daily
transacted in each of the agents’ great “receiving-sheds,” there
are nine other sheds, in which, throughout the day, and especially
at night, the same process on a smaller scale is going on.
Close to these stores there is also a water-dock for iron and
heavy goods to be shipped for the Thames. The carting establishments
of Messrs. Pickford and Chaplin for the collection
and delivery of their share only of the goods-traffic—for the
Company have establishments of their own for loading and unloading
at every station except London—would appear to any
foreigner unacquainted with the modest and unassuming powers
with which the mercantile business of England is quietly
transacted, to be incomprehensible and almost incredible. For

<p class="unindent">And yet the Company’s merchandise operations at Liverpool
exceed those at London in the proportion of 9 to 6½!</p>

<p>As soon as the two agents, at their respective receiving-sheds,
have loaded their trucks, and have securely covered them with
water-proof and fire-proof tarpaulins, they turn them out, labelled,
into the open air, from which moment they are considered to be
in the hands of the Company’s superintendent of the goods-department.
Accordingly, under his direction, they are immediately
drawn by horses first over a weighbridge to receive their
weigh-bills, and thence to a series of ten turn-tables, by which
they are scattered among thirteen sets of rails, where they are
marshalled into trains for their respective destinations. In this
operation it is alarming to see the superintendent’s horses dragging
the various luggage-vans, for not only are the rails as well
as the pavement between them exceedingly slippery, but as the
carriages have no shafts, the poor horse has not power to stop
his load, and accordingly affixed to it by his traces he trots away
before it, until it appears as if he must inevitably be smashed to
a sandwich between it and the carriage at rest which he is approaching;
however, just before the collision between the buffers
of each vehicle takes place, the dull-looking animal jumps aside,
and very dexterously saves himself from annihilation. The luggage-trains
thus formed are usually composed of 35, but sometimes
of 70 or 90 waggons, weighing when empty about three
tons each, and averaging when laden about six tons. At the
rear of each of these trains there sits a guard. The Company’s
goods-waggons of all descriptions amount in number to 6236.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Engine Stable and Cattle Wharf.</i></p>

<p>In order to prevent the locomotive engines which draw these
luggage-trains from crossing, or otherwise perilling the main
passenger-line at Camden Station, there has been constructed an
immense rotunda, 160 feet in diameter, lighted from the top by
plates of glass nine feet in length by half an inch thick, and
capable of containing twenty-four of the largest-class engines.
In the centre of this great brick building there is a turn-table
40 feet in diameter, from whence the engines radiate to their
twenty-four stalls, which on a large scale much resemble those
constructed in a stable for hunters. The majority of these locomotives
are capable of drawing 600 tons at the rate of twelve
miles an hour. Each, when supplied with coke and water, with
steam up ready for its journey, weighs about 50 tons. At the
entrance of this building there is a pit into which, after their
journey, they may drop their fire, and between the rails in each
of the twenty-four stalls we observed a smaller pit to enable artificers
to work beneath any engine that may require reparation.
The drivers of these huge locomotives, after every journey, inspect
and report in a book, as in the passenger-trains, any repairs
that may be required, and the engines are thoroughly cleaned
every time they come in.</p>

<p>At a short distance from this rotunda we observed a platform
about 300 yards long, constructed for the landing of cattle, which
arrive there generally on Thursdays and Saturdays from 2 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span>
till midnight. Fifty waggon-loads of bullocks, sheep, or pigs
can here be unloaded at a time, and then driven into strong pens
or pounds, constructed in the rear. The Company’s cattle and
merchandise waggons are usually painted blue, their sheep-waggons
green. On the arrival of a train of cattle it is interesting
to see such a quantity of polished horns, bright eyes, streams of
white breath, and healthy black wet noses projecting above the
upper rail of their respective waggons, and fatal as is the object
of their visit to John Bull’s metropolis, it is some consolation to
reflect that—poor things—they are, at all events, in ignorance
of the fate that awaits them. In disembarking the cattle, in
spite of every precaution, an enfuriated Welsh or a wild Irish
bullock will occasionally escape from this platform, and by
roaring, jumping, and galloping, with depressed head and up-stretched
<span class="lock">tail—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Hereditary bondsmen! know ye not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Who would be free, himself must strike the blow!”—</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>create no small consternation as well as confusion among the
green-coated pointsmen, porters, and policemen in charge of the
various sets of tributary rails which flow from the waggon department
into the main line. Instead, however, of attempting, as in
the case of Mr. Smith O’Brien, to capture the fugitive by force,
this object is effected by the simple stratagem of instantly turning
loose several other black-nosed bullocks, which he no sooner sees,
than, running and galloping towards the herd, he is quietly driven
with them into a pen, where he appears quite to enjoy “the
Union,” which a few minutes ago he had so violently and so vociferously
attempted to “<em>repale</em>.”</p>


<p class="center"><i>Waggon Hospital.</i></p>

<p>Among the large establishments at Camden Station is one for
the maintenance and repair of the luggage-trucks and goods-carriages
of the Southern District, namely, from London to Birmingham—in
which alone there are 2000 luggage-waggons with
a proportionate number of trucks. The construction-shop for
this department, in which 129 men were at work, is 437 feet in
length by 64 in breadth. With its sideways it is capable of containing
and of repairing at one time 100 carriages; the average
number in hospital being, however, from 60 to 70. In the
smiths’ shop we observed working at once 14 common forges
blown by steam, also four portable ones. In locked-up vaulted
stores adjoining there was lying, besides deals and Memel planks,
4000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> worth of oak timber in scantlings of the various sizes required,
each lot ticketed with its dimensions. It is surprising to
observe the quantity of iron and oak timber used in the construction
of the Company’s luggage-trucks. Nevertheless, although
they are built infinitely stronger in proportion than any ship (for
their oak stancheons, being straight instead of curved, when they
come in collision strike end foremost), yet we witnessed results
of accidents which were really appalling; in many cases the
largest of these timbers had been splintered; indeed, in a railway
smash the British oak usually either stands the shock without
flinching, or, if it <em>does</em> give, shivers into atoms. Barring,
however, accidents, a luggage-truck or waggon will last about
twelve years.</p>

<p>Among the Company’s goods-carriages we observed eight
powder-magazines, constructed under a patent invention of the
superintendent, Mr. Henson. They were covered outside with
sheet iron, lined with wood, had leaden floors, and the axles were
cased with hornbeam to prevent vibration. With these precautions
they each safely convey 4½ tons of gunpowder through and
over the sparks of fire and red-hot coals that are continually,
during the progress of a train, flying from the funnel-pipe or
dropping from the furnace of the engine.</p>

<p>As soon as a luggage-train has been unloaded at Camden Station
all the wheels of the waggons are gauged to see that there
are no bent axles, and that none of the “journals,” or working
ends of the axles, have been heated, for they sometimes get red-hot;
and we may here remark, that under heavy loads the tremendous
vibration of the axles of goods-carriages during their
journeys materially alters the composition of the iron, and that
when the axles have once been red-hot, although after cooling
they are as strong as ever, they are always particularly liable to
get red-hot again, and the brass boxes amalgamating with the
iron, the ends of the largest axles are occasionally wrenched off
as one would break a carrot. The luggage-waggons are minutely
inspected on arriving and on departing from Camden, Wolverton,
and Rugby; besides which the guard hastily examines them at
every station, where they are also greased if required.</p>


<p class="center"><i>The Pointsman.</i></p>

<p>Among the servants of a railway company, or rather we should
say of the public, there is no one who, in his secluded station,
has more important duties to attend to than “the pointsman,” in
charge of the switches for diverting a train from one set of rails
to another. As it is of course necessary that these switches
should be carefully worked and guarded by night as well as by
day, there are usually appointed to each station two pointsmen,
each of whom remains on duty twelve hours at a time, taking the
night and day work week about. At Camden Station one of
these men has fourteen switches to attend to, and at Wolverton
thirteen pairs. At the latter place, to prevent intrusion and to
increase precaution, the pointsman has always the signal of
danger on, but on perceiving an up-train about a mile off, he
shows a green flag to the Station signal-man, and does not avert
that of danger until he has received answer that “all is right.”
In thick weather he himself works a subterranean auxiliary signal
500 yards off, showing lamps of different colours. In a fog, to
prevent any train running into the station, a man is sent down
the line about a mile, to affix upon the rails, every 200 yards, one
of Toy and Hansom’s patent fog-signals, which, exploding under
the engine with the report of a small cannon, warn the driver to
stop and remain where he is, until some one comes to give him
orders. At Crewe Station, from whence radiate three important
lines of rails, namely, on the right to Manchester, straight on to
Liverpool, and on the left to Chester, there are constantly on
duty three pointsmen, one of whom has seventeen pairs of points
to attend to, namely, five belonging to the Chester line, one to
the Liverpool, eleven to the workshops. His box stands between
the Liverpool and Chester lines.</p>

<p>Nothing can apparently be more cheerless than the existence
of these poor fellows, who, cut off from society, in all weathers
and in all seasons have, in solitude, to perform duties for which
no passing traveller ever thanks them, and which he probably
does not even know that they perform. It is, however, providentially
decreed that the human heart warms under almost every
description of responsibility; and, accordingly, we invariably
found these pointsmen not only contented, but apparently intently
interested in their important duties; indeed the flowers which we
observed blooming around their little wooden habitations were
not, we felt, unappropriate emblems of the happiness which
naturally springs up in the heart of every man who will honestly
perform the duties of his station. The Company’s pointsmen
have nominally not very high wages:—a gratuity, however,
every twelve months is given to them, provided they cause no
accident; but should one occur from their switches, no matter
how small, they forfeit it—an arrangement, we think, very cleverly
conceived.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Wolverton.</span></h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Flying</span> by rail through green fields below Harrow Hill and
thence to Watford,—stopping for a moment in a deep cutting
to hear a man cry “<cite>Tring!</cite>” and a bell say “<cite>Ring!</cite>” until the
passenger gets so confused with the paltry squabble that he
scarcely knows which of the two competitors is vociferating the
substantive and which the verb,—we will now conduct our
readers to the Station and little town of Wolverton.</p>

<p>As every city, village, or hamlet on the surface of the globe is
usually inhabited by people of peculiar opinions, professions,
character, tastes, fashions, follies, whims, and oddities, so there is
always to be witnessed a corresponding variety in the allinement
and architecture of their dwellings—the forms and excrescences
of each often giving to the passing traveller a sort of phrenological
insight into the character of the inmates. One street, inhabited
by poor people, is as crooked as if it had been traced out by the
drunken Irishman who, on being kindly questioned, in a very narrow
lane across which he was reeling, as to the length of road he
had travelled, replied, “<cite>Faith! it’s not so much the length of it
as the</cite> <span class="allsmcap">BREADTH</span> <em>of it that has tired me</em>!” Another—a rich street—is
quite straight. Here is a palace—there are hovels. The hotel
is of one shape—the stock-exchange of another. There are private
houses of every form—shops of every colour—columns,
steeples, fountains, obelisks <i lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. Conspicuous over one
door there is to be seen a golden pestle and mortar—from another
boldly projects a barber’s pole—a hatchment decorates a third—the
Royal Arms a fourth—in short, it would be endless to enumerate
the circumstantial evidence which in every direction
proves the truth of the old saving, “<cite>Many men, many minds</cite>.”</p>

<p>To all general rules, however, there are exceptions; and certainly
it would be impossible for our most popular auctioneer, if
he wished ever so much to puff off the appearance of Wolverton,
to say more of it than that it is a little red-brick town composed
of 242 little red-brick houses—all running either this way or that
way at right angles—three or four tall red-brick engine-chimneys,
a number of very large red-brick workshops, six red houses for
officers—one red beer-shop, two red public-houses, and, we are
glad to add, a substantial red school-room and a neat stone
church, the whole lately built by order of a Railway Board, at a
railway station, by a railway contractor, for railway men, railway
women, and railway children; in short, the round cast-iron plate
over the door of every house, bearing the letters L. N. W. R.,
is the generic symbol of the town. The population is 1405, of
whom 638 are below sixteen years of age; indeed, at Wolverton
are to be observed an extraordinary number of young couples,
young children, young widows, also a considerable number of
men who have lost a finger, hand, arm, or leg. All, however,
whether whole or mutilated, look for support to “the Company,”
and not only their services and their thoughts but their parts of
speech are more or less devoted to it:—for instance, the pronoun
“<em>she</em>” almost invariably alludes to some locomotive
engine; “<em>he</em>” to “the chairman;” “<em>it</em>” to the London Board.
At Wolverton the progress of time itself is marked by the
hissing of the various arrival and departure trains. The driver’s
wife, with a sleeping infant at her side, lies watchful in her
bed until she has blessed the passing whistle of “the down
mail.” With equal anxiety her daughter long before daylight
listens for the rumbling of “the 3½ <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> goods up,” on the tender
of which lives the ruddy but smutty-faced young fireman to
whom she is engaged. The blacksmith as he plies at his anvil,
the turner as he works at his lathe, as well as their children at
school, listen with pleasure to certain well-known sounds on the
rails which tell them of approaching rest.</p>

<p>The workshops at Wolverton, taken altogether, form, generally
speaking, an immense hospital or “Hôtel des Invalides”
for the sick and wounded locomotive engines of the Southern
District. We witnessed sixty of them undergoing various operations,
more or less severe, at the same time. Among them was
Crampton’s new six-wheel engine, the hind wheels of which are
eight feet high, weighing thirty-eight tons, and with its tender
sixty tons. It is capable of drawing at the usual speed twelve
carriages laden with passengers. The workshops at this station
are so extensive, that it would be tedious and indeed almost impracticable
to describe them in detail; we will therefore merely
mention that in one of them we saw working at once by the
power of an 18-horse steam-engine twelve turning-lathes, five
planing-machines, three slotting-machines, two screw-bolt ditto—and,
as a trifling example of the undeviating accuracy with which
these contrivances work, we may state that from a turning-lathe a
shaving from cold iron will sometimes continue to flow for forty
feet without breaking. There are a large cast-iron foundry, a
brass foundry, machines for grinding, and also for polishing;
sheers for cutting, and stamps for punching cold iron as if it were
pasteboard; an immense oven for heating tires of wheels; a
smith’s shop containing twenty-four forges, all of which were
in operation at once. Two steam-engines—one for machinery,
the other for pumping water for the town and offices only,
for the Company’s well-water here, as at Camden Station, disagrees
with the locomotives. A large finishing store, in which
were working by steam fifteen turning-lathes, five slotting-machines,
five planing ditto, one screwing ditto, two drilling ditto,
two shaving ditto. Beneath the above we entered another workshop
containing sixteen turning-lathes, two drilling-machines,
one slotting ditto, one screwing ditto, one nut ditto, one cylinder-boring
ditto, one shaping ditto. In the great store-yard there is
an hydraulic press of a power of 200 tons for squeezing wheels
on to their axles, or wrenching them off. Another workshop is
filled with engines undergoing repair, and adjoining it there is a
large store or pharmacopœia, containing, in the form of oil,
tallow, nuts, bars, bolts, &amp;c., all the medicine which sick locomotives
occasionally require.</p>

<p>At a short distance towards the south we entered a beautiful
building, lighted during the day by plate-glass in the roof, by
gas at night, and warmed by steam. In its centre there stands
a narrow elevated platform, whereon travels a small locomotive,
which brings into the building, and deposits on thirteen sets of
rails on each side, twenty-six locomotive engines for examination
and repair. On the outside, in the open air, we found at work
what is called “<em>a scrap drum</em>” which by revolving cleans scraps
of old rusty iron, just as a public school improves awkward boys
by hardly rubbing them one against another. The scrap iron,
after having been by this discipline divested of its rust, is piled
on a small wooden board for further schooling, and when sufficiently
hot the glowing mass is placed under a steam-hammer
alongside, whose blows, each equal to about ten tons, very shortly
belabour to “equality and fraternity” the broken bolts, bars, nuts,
nails, screw-pins, bits of plate-iron, &amp;c., which are thus economically
welded into a solid mass or commonwealth. In another
smelting-shop, 150 feet in length, we saw at work fourteen
forges, six turning-lathes, one drilling-machine, and one iron-shaving
machine. Lastly, there are gas-works for supplying
the whole of the Company’s establishment with about seventy or
eighty thousand cubic feet of gas per day.</p>

<p>The above is but a faint outline of the Company’s hospital at
Wolverton for the repair and maintenance merely of their locomotive
engines running between London and Birmingham.</p>

<p>The magnitude of the establishment will best speak for itself;
but as our readers, like ourselves, are no doubt tired almost to
death of the clanking of anvils—of the whizzing of machinery—of
the disagreeable noises created by the cutting, shaving, turning,
and planing of iron—of the suffocating fumes in the brass-foundry,
in the smelting-houses, in the gas-works—and lastly of
the stunning blows of the great steam-hammer—we beg leave to
offer them a cup of black tea at the Company’s public refreshment-room,
in order that, while they are blowing, sipping, and
enjoying the beverage, we may briefly explain to them the nature
of this beautiful little oasis in the desert.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Wolverton Refreshment-Room.</i></p>

<p>In dealing with the British nation, it is an axiom among those
who have most deeply studied our noble character, that to keep
John Bull in beaming good-humour it is absolutely necessary to
keep him always <em>quite full</em>. The operation is very delicately
called “<em>refreshing him</em>;” and the London and North-Western
Railway Company having, as in duty bound, made due arrangements
for affording him, once in about every two hours, this
support, their arrangements not only constitute a curious feature
in the history of railway management, but the <i lang="la">dramatis personæ</i>
we are about to introduce form, we think, rather a strange contrast
to the bare arms, muscular frames, heated brows, and
begrimed faces of the sturdy workmen we have just left.</p>

<p>The refreshment establishment at Wolverton is composed <span class="lock">of—</span></p>


<ul><li>1. A matron or generallissima.</li>

<li>2. Seven very young ladies to wait upon the passengers.</li>

<li>3. Four men and three boys do. do.</li>

<li>4. One man-cook, his kitchen-maid, and his two scullery-maids.</li>

<li>5. Two housemaids.</li>

<li>6. One still-room-maid, employed solely in the liquid duty of making tea and coffee.</li>

<li>7. Two laundry-maids.</li>

<li>8. One baker and one baker’s-boy.</li>

<li>9. One garden-boy.</li>
</ul>

<p>And lastly, what is most significantly described in the books
of the <span class="lock">establishment—</span></p>


<ul><li>10. “An odd-man.”</li>
</ul>

<p class="center">
“Homo sum, humani nihil à me alienum puto.”<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent">There are also eighty-five pigs and piglings, of whom hereafter.</p>

<p>The manner in which the above list of persons, in the routine
of their duty, diurnally revolve in “the scrap-drum” of their
worthy matron, is as follows:—Very early in the morning—in
cold winter long before sunrise—“the odd-man” wakens the two
house-maids, to one of whom is intrusted the confidential duty of
awakening the seven young ladies exactly at seven o’clock, in
order that their “première toilette” may be concluded in time for
them to receive the passengers of the first train, which reaches
Wolverton at 7h. 30m. <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> From that time until the departure
of the passengers by the York Mail train, which arrives opposite
to the refreshment-room at about eleven o’clock at night, these
young persons remain on duty, continually vibrating, at the
ringing of a bell, across the rails—(they have a covered passage
high above them, but they never use it)—from the North refreshment-room
for down passengers to the South refreshment-room
constructed for hungry up-ones. By about midnight, after having
philosophically divested themselves of the various little bustles of
the day, they all are enabled once again to lay their heads on
their pillows, with the exception of one, who in her turn, assisted
by one man and one boy of the establishment, remains on duty
receiving the money, &amp;c. till four in the morning for the up-mail.
The young person, however, who in her weekly turn performs
this extra task, instead of rising with the others at seven, is
allowed to sleep on till noon, when she is expected to take her
place behind the long table with the rest.</p>

<p>The scene in the refreshment-room at Wolverton, on the
arrival of every train, has so often been witnessed by our readers,
that it need hardly be described. As these youthful handmaidens
stand in a row behind bright silver urns, silver coffee-pots,
silver tea-pots, cups, saucers, cakes, sugar, milk, with other
delicacies over which they preside, the confused crowd of passengers
simultaneously liberated from the train hurry towards them
with a velocity exactly proportionate to their appetites. The
hungriest face first enters the door, “magnâ comitante catervâ,”
followed by a crowd very much resembling in eagerness and
joyous independence the rush at the prorogation of Parliament
of a certain body following their leader from one house to the
bar of what they mysteriously call ‘another place.’ Considering
that the row of young persons have among them all only seven
right hands, with but very little fingers at the end of each, it is
really astonishing how, with such slender assistance, they can in
the short space of a few minutes manage to extend and withdraw
them so often—sometimes to give a cup of tea—sometimes to
receive half-a-crown, of which they have to return two shillings—then
to give an old gentleman a plate of warm soup—then to
drop another lump of sugar into his nephew’s coffee-cup—then to
receive a penny for a bun, and then again threepence for four
“lady’s fingers.” It is their rule as well as their desire never,
if they can possibly prevent it, to speak to any one; and although
sometimes, when thunder has turned the milk, or the kitchenmaid
over-peppered the soup, it may occasionally be necessary to
soothe the fastidious complaints of some beardless ensign by an
infinitesimal appeal to the generous feelings of his nature—we
mean, by the hundred-thousandth part of a smile—yet they
endeavour on no account ever to exceed that harmless dose.
But while they are thus occupied at the centre of the refreshment
table, at its two ends, each close to a warm stove, a very
plain matter-of-fact business is going on, which consists of the
rapid uncorking of, and then emptying into large tumblers,
innumerable black bottles of what is not unappropriately called
“<em>Stout</em>,” inasmuch as all the persons who are drinking the dark
foaming mixture wear heavy great-coats, with large wrappers
round their necks—in fact, are <em>very</em> stout. We regret to have to
add, that among these thirsty customers are to be seen, quite in
the corner, several silently tossing off glasses of brandy, rum,
and gin; and although the refreshment-room of the Wolverton
Station is not adapted for a lecture, we cannot help submitting
to the managers of the Company, that, considering not only the
serious accidents that may occur to individual passengers from
intoxication, but the violence and insolence which drunken men
may inflict upon travellers of both sexes, whose misfortune it may
be to be shut up with them; considering moreover the ruin which
a glass or two of brandy may bring upon a young non-commissioned
officer in the army, as also the heavy punishment it may
entail upon an old soldier, it would be well for them peremptorily
to forbid, at all their refreshment-rooms, the sale by any of their
servants, to the public, of ardent spirits.</p>

<p>But the bell is violently calling the passengers to ‘Come!
come away!’—and as they have all paid their fares, and as the
engine is loudly hissing—attracted by their pockets as well as by
their engagements, they soon, like the swallows of summer, congregate
together and then fly away.</p>

<p>It appears from the books that the annual consumption at the
refreshment-rooms <span class="lock">averages—</span></p>

<p>Having, in the refreshment sketch which we have just concluded,
partially detailed, at some length, the duties of the seven young
persons at Wolverton, we feel it due to them, as well as to those
of our readers who, we perceive, have not yet quite finished their
tea, by a very few words to complete their history. It is never
considered quite fair to pry into the private conduct of any one
who performs his duty to the public with zeal and assiduity.
The warrior and the statesman are not always immaculate; and
although at the Opera ladies certainly sing very high, and in the
ballet kick very high, it is possible that their voices and feet may
sometimes reach rather higher than their characters. Considering,
then, the difficult duties which our seven young attendants
have to perform—considering the temptations to which they are
constantly exposed, in offering to the public attentions which are
ever to simmer and yet never to boil—it might be expected that
our inquiries should considerately go no further than the arrival at
11 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> of “the up York mail.” The excellent matron, however,
who has charge of these young people—who always dine and live
at her table—with honest pride declares, that the breath of slander
has never ventured to sully the reputation of any of those who
have been committed to her charge; and as this testimony is corroborated
by persons residing in the neigbourhood and very
capable of observation, we cannot take leave of the establishment
without expressing our approbation of the good sense and attention
with which it is conducted; and while we give credit to the young
for the character they have maintained, we hope they will be
gratefully sensible of the protection they have received.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Postscript.</i></p>

<p>We quite forgot to mention that, notwithstanding the everlasting
hurry at this establishment, four of the young attendants
have managed to make excellent marriages, and are now very
well off in the world.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Gardens, Libraries, and Schools.</i></p>

<p>Before leaving Wolverton Station our readers will no doubt be
desirous to ascertain what arrangements, if any, are made by the
Company for the comfort, education, and religious instruction of
the number of artificers and other servants whom we have lately
seen hard at work. On the western boundary of the town we
visited 130 plots of ground, containing about 324 square yards
each, which are let by the Company at a very trifling rent to those
who wish for a garden; and, accordingly, whenever one of these
plots is given up, it is leased to him whose name stands first on the
list of applicants. A reading-room and library lighted by gas are
also supplied free of charge by the Company. In the latter there
are about 700 volumes, which have mostly been given; and
the list of papers, &amp;c. in the reading-room was as follows:—Times,
Daily News, Bell’s Life, Illustrated News, Punch,
Weekly Dispatch, Liverpool Albion, Glasgow Post, Railway
Record, Airs’ Birmingham Gazette, Bentley’s Miscellany,
Chambers’ Information, Chambers’ Journal, Chambers’ Shilling
Volume, Practical Mechanic’s Journal, Mechanic’s Magazine.</p>

<p>Besides the above there is a flying library of about 600 volumes
for the clerks, porters, police, as also for their wives and families,
residing at the various stations, consisting of books of all kinds,
excepting on politics and on religious controversies. They are
despatched to the various stations, carriage free, in nineteen boxes
given by the Company, each of which can contain from twenty to
fifty volumes.</p>

<p>For the education of the children of the Company’s servants,
a school-house, which we had much pleasure in visiting, has been
constructed on an healthy eminence, surrounded by a small
court and garden. In the centre there is a room for girls, who,
from nine till five, are instructed by a governess in reading,
writing, arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, and needlework.
Engaged at these occupations we counted fifty-five clean, healthy
faces. In the east wing we found about ninety fine, stout,
athletic boys, of various ages, employed in the studies above
mentioned (excepting the last), and learning, moreover,
mathematics and drawing. One boy we saw solving a quadratic
equation—another was engaged with Euclid—others with studying
land-surveying, levelling, trigonometry, and one had reached
conic sections.</p>

<p>At the western extremity of the building, on entering the
infant-school, which is under the superintendence of an intelligent
looking young person of about nineteen years of age, we
were struck by the regular segments in which the little creatures
were standing in groups around a tiny monitor occupying the
centre of each chord. We soon, however, detected that this regularity
of their attitudes was caused by the insertion in the floor of
various chords of hoop iron, the outer rims of which they all
touched with their toes. A finer set of little children we have
seldom beheld; but what particularly attracted our attention was
three rows of beautiful babies sitting as solemn as judges on
three steps one above another, the lowest being a step higher
than the floor of the room. They were learning the first hard
lesson of this world—namely, to sit still; and certainly the occupation
seemed to be particularly well adapted to their outlines;
indeed their pinafores were so round, and their cheeks so red,
that altogether they resembled three rows of white dumplings,
with a rosy-faced apple on each. The picture was most interesting;
and we studied their cheerful features until we almost
fancied that we could analyze and distinguish which were little
fire-flies—which small stokers—tiny pokers—infant artificers,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>On leaving the three rooms full of children, to whom, whatever
may be the religion of their parents, the Perpetual Curate,
the Rev. G. Weight, is apparently devoting very praiseworthy
attention, we proceeded eastward about 100 yards to the church,
the property of the Radcliffe Trustees, the interior of which is
appropriately fitted up with plain oak-coloured open seats, all
alike. In the churchyard, which is of very considerable area,
there are, under the north wall, a row of fraternal mounds side
by side, with a solitary shrub or a few flowers at the foot of each,
showing that those who had there reached their earthly terminus
were kindly recollected by a few still travelling on the rails of
life. With the exception, however, of the grave of one poor
fellow, whose death under amputation, rendered necessary from
severe fractures, has been commemorated on a tombstone by his
comrades, there exists no interesting epitaph. Besides this
church, a room in the library is used, when required, as a
Wesleyan Chapel; at which on Sundays there are regular
preachers both morning and night—and on Tuesdays and Fridays
about 100 of the Company’s servants attend extempore prayers
by one of their brother artificers.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the manifold arrangements which characterise the interior
of the British hive there is, we believe, no one which offers
to an intelligent observer a more important moral than the
respect which is everywhere paid by us to the correspondence of
the nation. Prior to the introduction of railways our post-office
establishment was the admiration of every foreigner who visited
us. But although our light mail-coaches, high-bred horses,
glittering harness, skilful coachmen, resolute guards, and macadamised
roads were undeniably of the very best description, yet
the moral basis on which the whole fabric rested, or rather the
power which gave vitality to its movements, evidently was a
patriotic desire indigenous in the minds of people of all classes
to protect, as their common wealth, the correspondence of the
country; and accordingly it mattered not whether on our public
thoroughfares were to be seen a butcher’s cart, a brewer’s dray,
a bishop’s coach, a nobleman’s landau, the squire’s chariot or his
tenant’s waggon;—it mattered not what quantity of vehicles
were assembled for purposes good, bad, or indifferent, for church,
for race-course, or for theatre;—it mattered not for what party
of pleasure or for what political purpose a crowd or a mob might
have assembled; for at a single blast through a long tin horn
people of all ranks and conditions, however they might be disposed
to dispute on all other subjects, were ready from all quarters
to join together in exclaiming, “<span class="smcap">Make way for the mail!</span>”</p>

<p>At the magic whistle of the locomotive engine the whole of
the extremely slow, dull, little-bag system we have just referred
to suddenly fell to pieces. Nevertheless, the spirit that had
animated it flew from the road to the rails, and although our
penny-postal arrangements, notwithstanding their rapid growth,
are less conspicuous, there exists throughout the country the
same honest anxiety that our letter-bags should be circulated
over the surface of the United Kingdom with the utmost possible
care and despatch. In order, however, to fulfil this general
desire the duties which our Postmaster-General is now required
to perform are most extraordinary.</p>

<p>The difficulty of transmitting from London to every part of
the United Kingdom, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, the innumerable quantity of
letters which, like mushrooms springing up from a bed of spawn,
have arisen from our sudden adoption of a penny-postage, would
alone require minute calculations, involving an infinity of details;
but when it is considered that besides this circulation from and
to the heart of the metropolis—(the average weight of letters
and newspapers carried daily by the London and North-Western
Railway is seventeen tons)—there exists simultaneously a cross
circulation, not only from and to every great city and town, but
from every little post-office to every part of the United Kingdom
and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, and moreover to every region on the globe, the
eccentric zigzag courses of all these letters to their respective
destinations may justly be compared to the fiery tracks and sparks
created by the sudden ignition of a sackful of fireworks of all
descriptions; of rockets, Catherine wheels, Roman candles,
squibs, stars, crackers, flower-pots, some flying straight away,
while others are revolving, twisting, radiating, bouncing, exploding
in every possible direction and in all ways at once.</p>

<p>To explain the mode in which all our postal arrangements are
conducted would not only exceed our limits, but be foreign to
our subject; we will therefore only attempt to supply our
readers with a slight sketch of a very small portion of this business,
namely, the transmission of letters from the metropolis by
the London and North-Western Railway’s night mail.</p>

<p>While the passengers by the Lancashire mail-train are taking
their seats and making other preparations for their departure,
two or three Post-office vans are seen to enter the main carriage
gate of the Euston Station, and then to drive close to their tenders
on the railway, which form the last carriages of the train. The
servants of the Post-office, rapidly unloading their vans, remove
a portion of the bags they contained into the travelling-office and
the remainder into two large tenders, which, as soon as they are
filled, are locked up by the guard, who then takes his place in
the flying office, in which we propose to leave him to his flight
for 132½ miles—only observing, however, that no sooner has he
started than another flying post-office, which had been lying in
ambush, advances (with its tender), and, after being loaded in a
similar manner, in a quarter of an hour they are despatched to
Yorkshire and the East of Scotland.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It had been raining for upwards of twenty-four hours, and it
was still pouring when, at about half-past one o’clock of a dark
winter’s night, we reached the railway platform at Stafford, to
await there the arrival from Euston Station of the night-mail,
whose loading and departure we have just described. At that
lonely hour, excepting a scarlet-coated guard, who, watching
over a pile of letter-bags just arrived from Birmingham by a
branch-train, was also waiting for the down-mail, there were
no other passengers on the platform; and, save the unceasing
pattering of the rain, there appeared nothing to attract the attention
but the glaring lamps of three or four servants of the Company.
One with his lantern in his left hand was writing in a
small memorandum-book placed on a desk before him. Two
others with lights suspended round their necks were greasing the
axles of some carriage whose form could not be distinguished,
while the station-man on duty with his lamp in his hand was
pacing up and down the boarded platform.</p>

<p>At this moment the signal-man had scarcely announced the
approach of an up-train when there rapidly rushed by a very
long, low, dark, solid mass protected by some sort of wet black-looking
covering which here and there glistened as it rolled
past the four lamps that were turned towards it; in short, it was a
common luggage-train. The whole line of waggons, their various
contents, as well as the powerful puffing engine that was dragging
them through utter darkness, were all inanimate; and it was
almost appalling to reflect that, in case of any accident to the
drivers, the great train with two red eyes shining in front as well
as in rear would proceed alone on its dark iron path—lifeless—senseless—reckless
of human life—unconscious of the agonies it
might cause or the mischief it might create. It was the work of
man—and yet it was ignorant of his power, or even of his name.
Devoid of reason or of instinct, it knew nothing—saw nothing—heard
nothing—loved nothing—hated nothing—cared for nothing—had
no pleasures—no pains—nothing to fear—nothing
to hope for; it knew not whence it came,—it rushed forwards it
knew not why,—to go it knew not where; it had substance, it
had motion, it produced loud sounds, and yet it was as lonely
and as destitute of life as the heavens and the earth when in
chaos they were without form and void, and when darkness was
upon the face of the deep! But these reflections were agreeably
interrupted by the arrival of a down-train, swarming alive with
passengers, whose busy feet were very shortly to be heard trampling
in all directions along or across the platform. At the same
time the conductor of the train was delivering over to the Post-office-guard,
who had so patiently been awaiting their arrival, a
quantity of leather bags of all sizes—white, brown, or black,
according to their ages—and which remained in a large heap on
the platform until, in about eight minutes, the signal-bell
announced first the approach and then the arrival of “the down
London mail.”</p>

<p>As soon as this train, which we had been awaiting, stopped,
the door of the Flying Post-office was opened, and the bags
which had been lying on the platform were no sooner packed
either into it or into its tender behind, than, the engine-driver’s
whistle announcing the departure of the train, we without delay
presented an order which we had obtained to travel in the post-office
from Stafford to Crewe, and we were scarcely seated in a
corner on some letter-bags to witness the operations of its
inmates, when the train started and away we went!</p>


<p class="center"><i>The flying Post-office.</i></p>

<p>This office, which every evening flies away from London to
Glasgow, and wherein Government clerks are busily employed
in receiving, delivering, and sorting letters all the way, is a
narrow carpeted room, twenty-one feet in length by about
seven in breadth, lighted by four large reflecting lamps inserted
in the roof, and by another in a corner for the guard. Along
about two-thirds of the length of this chamber there is affixed
to the side wall a narrow table, or counter, covered with green
cloth, beneath which various letter bags are stowed away, and
above which the space up to the roof is divided into six shelves
fourteen feet in length, each containing thirty-five pigeon-holes
of about the size of the little compartments in a dove-cote. At
this table, and immediately fronting these pigeon-holes, there were
standing as we flew along, three Post-office clerks intently occupied
in convulsively snatching up from the green-cloth counter, and
in dexterously inserting into the various pigeon-holes, a mass of
letters which lay before them, and which, when exhausted, were
instantly replaced from bags which the senior clerk cut open,
and which the guard who had presented them then shook out for
assortment. On the right of the chief clerk the remaining one-third
of the carriage was filled nearly to the roof with letter-bags
of all sorts and sizes, and which an able-bodied Post-office
guard, dressed in his shirt-sleeves and laced waistcoat, was
hauling at and adjusting according to their respective brass-labels.
At this laborious occupation the clerks continue standing for
about four hours and a half; that is to say, the first set sort
letters from London to Tamworth, the second from Tamworth
to Preston, the third from Preston to Carlisle, and the fourth
letters from Carlisle to Glasgow. The clerks employed in this
duty do not permanently reside at any of the above stations, but
are usually removed from one to the other every three months.</p>

<p>As we sat reclining and ruminating in the corner, the scene
was as interesting as it was extraordinary. In consequence of
the rapid rate at which we were travelling, the bags which were
hanging from the thirty brass pegs on the sides of the office had
a tremulous motion, which at every jerk of the train was changed
for a moment or two into a slight rolling or pendulous movement,
like towels, &amp;c., hanging in a cabin at sea. While the
guard’s face, besides glistening with perspiration, was—from the
labour of stooping and hauling at large letter-bags—as red as
his scarlet coat which was hanging before the wall on a little
peg, until at last his cheeks appeared as if they were shining at
the lamp immediately above them almost as ruddily as the lamp
shone upon them—the three clerks were actively moving their
right hands in all directions, working vertically with the same
dexterity with which compositors in a printing-office horizontally
restore their type into the various small compartments to which
each letter belongs. Sometimes a clerk was seen to throw into
various pigeon-holes a batch of mourning letters, all directed in
the same handwriting, and evidently announcing some death;
then one or two registered letters wrapped in green covers. For
some time another clerk was solely employed in stuffing into
bags newspapers for various destinations. Occasionally the
guard, leaving his bags, was seen to poke his burly head out of a
large window behind him into pitch darkness, enlivened by the
occasional passage of bright sparks from the funnel-pipe of the
engine, to ascertain by the flashing of the lamps as he passed
them, the precise moment of the train clearing certain stations,
in order that he might record it in his “time-bill.” Then again
a strong smell of burning sealing-wax announced that he was
sealing up, and stamping with the Post-office seal, bags three or
four of which he then firmly strapped together for delivery. All
of a sudden, the flying chamber received a hard sharp blow,
which resounded exactly as if a cannon-shot had struck it. This
noise, however, merely announced that a station-post we were at
that moment passing, but which was already far behind us, had
just been safely delivered of four leather letter-bags, which on
putting our head out of the window, we saw quietly lying in the
far end of a large strong iron-bound sort of landing-net or
cradle, which the guard a few minutes before had by a simple
movement lowered on purpose to receive them. But not only
had we received four bags, but at the same moment, and apparently
by the same blow, we had, as we flew by, dropped at the
same station three bags which a Post-office authority had been
waiting there to receive. The blow that the pendent bag of
letters, moving at the rate say of forty miles an hour, receives
in being suddenly snatched away, must be rather greater than
that which the flying one receives on being suddenly at that rate
dropped on the road. Both operations, however, are effected by
a projecting apparatus from the flying post-office coming suddenly
into contact with that protruding from the post.</p>

<p>As fast as the clerks could fill the pigeon-holes before them,
the letters were quickly taken therefrom, tied up into a bundle,
and then by the guard deposited into the leather bag to which
they belonged. On very closely observing the clerks as they
worked, we discovered that, instead of sorting their letters into
the pigeon-holes according to their superscriptions, they placed
them into compartments of their own arrangement, and which
were only correctly labelled in their own minds; but as every
clerk is held answerable for the accuracy of his assortment, he is
very properly allowed to execute it in whatever way may be most
convenient to his mind or hand.</p>

<p>Besides lame writing and awkward spelling, it was curious to
observe what a quantity of irrelevant nonsense is superscribed
upon many letters, as if the writer’s object was purposely to conceal
from the sorting clerk the only fact he ever cares to ascertain,
namely, <em>the post town</em>. Their patience and intelligence,
however, are really beyond all praise; and although sometimes
they stand for eight or ten seconds holding a letter close to their
lamp, turning sometimes their head and then it, yet it rarely
happens that they fail to decipher it. In opening one bag, a
lady’s pasteboard work-box appeared all in shivers. It had been
packed in the thinnest description of whitey-brown paper. The
clerk spent nearly two minutes in searching among the fragments
for the direction, which he at last discovered in very pale ink,
written apparently through a microscope with the point of a
needle. The letters sorted in the flying post-office are, excepting
a few “late letters,” principally cross-post letters, which,
although packed into one bag, are for various localities. For
instance, at Stafford the mail takes up a bag made up for
Birmingham, Wolverhampton and intermediate places, the
letters for which, being intermixed, are sorted by the way, and
left at the several stations.</p>

<p>The bags have also to be stowed away in compartments according
to their respective destinations. One lot for Manchester,
Liverpool, and Dublin; one for Chester; a bundle of bags for
Newcastle-under-Lyne, Market-Drayton, Eccleshall, Stone,
Crewe, Rhuabon; a quantity of empty bags to be filled coming
back; a lot for Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Carlisle; and one
great open bag contained all the letter-bags for Dublin taken
upon the road.</p>

<p>The minute arrangements necessary for the transaction of all
this important business at midnight, while the train is flying
through the dark, it would be quite impossible to describe. The
occupation is not only highly confidential, but it requires unceasing
attention, exhausting to body and mind. Some time
ago, while the three clerks, with their right elbows moving in
all directions, were vigorously engaged in sorting their letters,
and while the guard, with the light of his lamp shining on the
gilt buttons and gold lace which emblazoned the pockets of his
waistcoat, was busily sealing a letter-bag, a collision took place,
which, besides killing four men, at the same moment chucked
the sorting clerks from their pigeon-holes to the letter-bags in
the guard’s compartment. In due time the chief clerk recovered
from the shock; but what had happened—why he was lying on
the letter-bags—why nobody was sorting—until he recovered
from his stupor he could not imagine.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Crewe.</span></h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">We</span> have now reached the most important station on the London
and North-Western Railway; indeed the works here are on a
scale which strikingly exemplifies the magnitude of the arrangements
necessary for the maintenance of an arterial railway.</p>

<p>The Company’s workshops at Crewe consist of a Locomotive
and of a Coach department. In the manufactories of the former
are constructed as well as repaired the whole of the engines and
tenders required for the Northern Division, namely, from Birmingham
to Liverpool; Rugby to Stafford; Crewe to Holyhead;
Liverpool to Manchester; Liverpool, Manchester, and Warrington
to Preston; Preston to Carlisle. The establishment also
“works,” as it is termed, the Lancaster and Carlisle and Chester
and Holyhead Lines. The total number of miles is at present
360, but the distance of course increases with the completion
of every new branch line. In this division there are 220
engines and tenders (each averaging in value nearly 2000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>),
of which at least 100 are at work every day. Besides repairing
all these, the establishment has turned out a new engine and
tender on every Monday morning since the 1st of January, 1848.
The number of workmen employed in the above department is
1600, their wages averaging 3800<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> a fortnight. The accounts
of these expenses, as also a book of “casualties,” in which every
accident to, as well as every delay of, a train is reported, are
examined once a fortnight by a special committee of directors.</p>

<p>Without attempting to detail the various establishments, we
will briefly describe a few of their most interesting features.</p>

<p>Close to the entrance of the Locomotive Department stands, as
its <i lang="la">primum mobile</i>, the tall chimney of a steam-pump, which,
besides supplying the engine that propels the machinery of the
workshops, gives an abundance of water to the locomotives at
the station, as also to the new railway town of Crewe, containing
at present about 8000 inhabitants. This pump lifts about eighty
or ninety thousand gallons of water per day from a brook below
into filtering-beds, whence it is again raised about forty feet into
a large cistern, where it is a second time filtered through charcoal
for the supply of the town. On entering the great gate of
the department, the office of which is up a small staircase on the
left hand, the first object of attention is the great engine-stable
into which the hot dusty locomotives are conducted after their
journeys to be cleaned, examined, repaired, or, if sound, to be
greased and otherwise prepared for their departure—the last
operation being to get up their steam, which is here effected by
coal, instead of coke, in about two hours.</p>

<p>After passing through a workshop containing thirty-four
planing and slotting machines in busy but almost silent operation,
we entered a smith’s shop, 260 feet long, containing forty
forges all at work. At several of the anvils there were three
and sometimes four strikers, and the quantity of sparks that more
or less were exploding from each,—the number of sledge-hammers
revolving in the air, with the sinewy frames, bare throats and
arms of the fine pale men who wielded them, formed altogether a
scene well worthy of a few moments’ contemplation. As the
heavy work of the department is principally executed in this
shop, in which iron is first enlisted and then rather roughly
drilled into the service of the Company, it might be conceived
that the music of the forty anvils at work would altogether be
rather noisy in concert. The grave itself, however, could
scarcely be more silent than this workshop, in comparison with
the one that adjoins it, in which the boilers of the locomotives
are constructed. As for asking questions of or receiving explanations
from the guide, who with motionless lips conducts the
stranger through this chamber, such an effort would be utterly
hopeless, for the deafening noise proceeding from the riveting of
the bolts and plates of so many boilers is distracting beyond
description. We almost fancied that the workmen must be
aware of this effect upon a stranger, and that on seeing us enter
they therefore welcomed our visit by a charivari sufficient to
awaken the dead. As we hurried through the din, we could not,
however, help pausing for a moment before a boiler of copper
inside and iron outside, within which there sat crouched up—like
a negro between the decks of a slave-ship—an intelligent-looking
workman holding with both hands a hammer against a
bolt, on the upper end of which, within a few inches of his ears,
two lusty comrades on the outside were hammering with surprising
strength and quickness. The noise which reverberated
within this boiler, in addition to that which was resounding without,
formed altogether a dose which it is astonishing the tympanum
of the human ear can receive uninjured; at all events we
could not help thinking that, if there should happen to exist on
earth any man ungallant enough to complain of the occasional
admonition of a female tongue, if he will only go by rail to
Crewe and sit in that boiler for half an hour, he will most surely
never again complain of the chirping of that “cricket on his
hearth”—the whispering curtain-lectures of his <i lang="la">dulce domum</i>.</p>

<p>The adjoining shop contains a brass and also an iron foundry,
in which were at work seven brass-moulders and five iron-moulders.
In the corner of this room we stood for a few
moments looking over the head and shoulders of a fine little boy
who was practically exemplifying the properties of the most
wonderful of the mineral productions of nature—the loadstone.
Among the mass brought into this workshop to be recast are
occasionally a quantity of brass shavings and other sweepings,
among which there is a small proportion of iron filings, &amp;c.
The little boy’s occupation consisted in constantly stirring up the
mass or mess before him with a magnet, which, as often as it
came out bristling with resplendent particles of iron of various
sizes, he swept clean, and then continued his work until the investigator
came out of the heap as clear of iron as it went in.</p>

<p>Close to this shop is one in which the models and patterns of
the castings are constructed. From a spacious open yard covered
with stacks of old scrap-iron, much of which was of the size of
common buttons, a door opens into a large shop containing
twelve forges solely used for the construction of engine-wheels,
which are forced on as well as off their axles by an ingenious
machine of extraordinary power. Adjoining the open yard we
saw in operation Nasmyth’s great steam-hammer, on the summit
of which there sat perched up a man who could regulate its blow
from say twenty-five tons to a little tap sufficient only to drive a
common-sized nail. As soon as the furnace-door on one side of
this hammer was opened, a large lump of scrap-iron at a white
heat was lifted and then conducted by a crane on to the anvil
beneath. At the same moment from an opposite furnace a long
iron bar, heated only at one extremity, was by a gentle blow of
the hammer no sooner welded to the mass than the head smith,
using it as a handle, turned and re-turned the lump on the anvil
so as to enable the steam-hammer to weld its contents into proper
form. Of course there has been selected for this extremely
heavy work the strongest man that could be obtained. He is of
about the height and bulk of the celebrated Italian singer Signor
Lablache, with apparently the strength of Hercules, or rather of
Vulcan himself—and certainly nothing could be a finer display
of muscular power than the various attitudes which this heavy
man assumed, as, regardless of the sparks which flew at him, or
of the white heat of the lump of iron he was forging, he turned
it on one side and then on the other, until at a given signal a
small smith in attendance placed a sort of heavy chisel on the
iron handle, which by a single blow of the steam-hammer was
at once severed from it, in order that it might be piled away and
another mass lifted from the fiery furnace to the anvil.</p>

<p>Close to this Cyclopean scene there is a shop solely for turning
wheels and axles, which, brought here rough from the smiths’
forges we have described, never leave this place until they are
ready to go under the engine for which they have been made.</p>

<p>After passing through a grinding-shop and a coppersmith’s
shop, which we must leave without comment, we entered a most
important and interesting workshop, 330 feet in length, by 60 feet
in breadth, termed the “fitting-shop,” because the work brought
here in various states is all finally finished and fitted for its object.
Besides 11 planing-machines, 36 shaping and slotting machines,
and 30 turning-lathes, all working by steam-power, we
observed, running nearly the whole length of the building, five
sets of tables, at which were busily employed in filing, rasping,
hammering, &amp;c., eight rows of “<em>vice-men</em>,” only so called because
they work at vices. The whole of the artificers in this room are
of the best description, and the importance of their duties cannot
perhaps be more briefly illustrated than by the simple fact that,
besides all the requisite repairs of 200 locomotive engines, they
were employed in finishing the innumerable details of 30 new ones
in progress. Some were solely engaged in converting bolts into
screws; some in fitting nuts; some in constructing brass whistles;
in short, in this division of labour almost every “vice man” was
employed in finishing some limb, joint, or other component part
of a locomotive engine destined to draw trains either of goods or
passengers.</p>

<p>After visiting a large store-room, in which all things appertaining
to engines, sorted and piled in innumerable compartments,
are guarded by a storekeeper, who registers in a book
each item that he receives and delivers, we will now introduce
our readers to the climax of the establishment, commonly called
“<em>the Erecting-shop</em>.” Hitherto we have been occupied in
following in tedious detail from the foundry to the forge, and
from the anvil to the vice, the various items, such as plates,
rivets, bolts, nuts, rings, stays, tubes, ferrules, steam-pipes,
exhausting-pipes, chimney-pipes, safety-valves, life-guards, axle-boxes,
pistons, cylinders, connecting-rods, splashers, leading and
trailing wheels, &amp;c., amounting in number to 5416 pieces, of
which a locomotive engine is composed. We have at last,
however, reached that portion of the establishment in which all
those joints, limbs, and boilers, which have been separately
forged, shaped, and finished in different localities, are assembled
together for the consummation of the especial object for which,
with so much labour and at so great an expense, they have been
prepared: indeed, nothing, we believe, can be more true than
Mr. Robert Stevenson’s well-known maxim—“<cite>A locomotive
engine must be put together as carefully as a watch!</cite>”</p>

<p>The Erecting-shop at Crewe is a room 300 feet long by 100
feet broad, containing five sets of rails, upon three of which are
erected the new engines and tenders—the other two being
usually occupied by those under heavy repair. The number of
artificers we found employed was 220. In this magnificent
building we saw in progress of erection 20 passenger-engines,
also 10 luggage-engines; and as this shop has (as we have before
stated) turned out a locomotive engine and tender complete on
every Monday morning for very nearly a year, and is continuing
to supply them at the same rate, we had before us in review
locomotive engines in almost every stage of progress; and when
we reflected on the innumerable benefits, and even blessings,
which resulted to mankind from their power, it was most
pleasing to be enabled at one view to see—as it were in
rehearsal behind the scenes—performers who were so shortly to
appear upon the stage of life.</p>

<p>At the further end of the line of rails close to the north wall
there appeared a long low tortuous mass of black iron-work,
without superstructure or wheels, in which the form of an engine-bed
in embryo could but very faintly be traced; a little nearer
was a similar mass, in which the outline appeared, from some
cause or other, to be more distinctly marked; nearer still the
same outline appeared upon wheels: to the next there had been
added a boiler and fire-box, without dome, steam-escape, or
funnel-pipe; nearer still the locomotive engine in its naked state
appeared, in point of form, complete:—and workmen were here
busily engaged in covering the boiler with a garment about half
an inch thick of hair-felt, upon which others were affixing a
covering of inch deal-plank, over which was to be tightly bound
a tarpaulin, the whole to be secured by iron-hoops. In the next
case the dome of the engine was undergoing a similar toilette,
excepting that, instead of a wooden upper garment, it was
receiving one of copper. Lastly—(it was on a Saturday that we
chanced to visit the establishment)—there stood at the head of
this list of recruits a splendid bran-new locomotive engine,
completely finished, painted bright green—the varnish was
scarcely dry—and in every respect perfectly ready to be delivered
over on Monday morning to run its gigantic course. On other
rails within the building were tenders in similar states of progress;
and, as the eye rapidly glanced down these iron rails, the finished
engine and tender immediately before it seemed gradually and
almost imperceptibly to dissolve, in proportion to its distance,
until nothing was left of each but an indistinct and almost unintelligible
dreamy vision of black iron-work. On one of the
furthest rails, among a number of engines that were undergoing
serious operations, we observed “<em>The Colonel</em>,” which, by going
off the rails at Newton Bridge, caused the death of General
Baird.</p>


<p class="center"><i>Coach Department.</i></p>

<p>As our readers will no doubt feel some little selfish interest in
the construction of the railway-carriages in which they travel,
we shall conclude our rapid survey of the Company’s workshops
at Crewe by a short inspection of the coach establishment. This
department constructs and maintains for the traffic on 393 miles
of rails all the requisite passenger-carriages, luggage-vans, travelling
post-offices and tenders, parcel-vans and parcel-carts,
milk-trucks (principally to supply Liverpool), and break-waggons.</p>

<p>At the Company’s “Waggon Department” at Manchester
are constructed and maintained all the requisite goods-waggons,
horse-boxes, coke-waggons, carriage-trucks for private carriages,
cattle-waggons and timber-trucks.</p>

<p>The total number of carriages of all descriptions maintained at
Crewe amounts to 670, of which about 100 at a time are usually
in hospital. There are generally from 30 to 40 new carriages in
progress: the number of workmen employed was 260. The
establishment is divided into one set of workshops for the construction,
and another for the repair of carriages.</p>

<p>1. In a large shop, 300 feet in length, warmed by steam, at
night lighted by gas, and by day from lofty windows on each side,
there is throughout the whole length of the building a wooden
pavement containing eight sets of rails, upon which we beheld,
like hackney-coaches on their stands, a variety of carriages in
various stages of construction and of alteration, each surrounded
by several intelligent artificers, who, instead of throwing away
their time in dancing round a tree of liberty, to the tune, or, as
it is poetically termed by M. Lamartine, “the dogma” of liberty,
fraternity, and <em>equality</em>, were sedulously occupied in framing different
sorts of carriages to suit the various gradations of human
society. For instance, one set, with beautiful colours, were painting
the outside of a “first class;” while their comrades within
were padding it, and petting it, and stuffing it, as if its object
were to fit every bend and hollow in the human frame. Another
set were strongly varnishing the wooden oak-painted interior of a
“second-class,” whose exterior had evidently received considerable
attention; while another gang were “finishing off” a covered
“third-class,” whose inside certainly appeared not only very hard,
but what old nurses term “terribly troubled with wind.”</p>

<p>In another quarter a set of workmen were economically converting
an old first-class into a second-class—the transmutation
being effected by taking out the lining, and then converting
large, fashionable, oval windows into little vulgar square ones.
But though comfort, like cheese, bacon, or any other description
of merchandise, was thus doled out to each class of passengers
according to the amount of it which they may desire to purchase,
the materials of all the carriages appeared to be of good
sound quality. The panels of first, second, and third-class carriages,
as well as those even of luggage-vans, are invariably made
of mahogany; “the bottom-sides” of English oak; the rest of the
framing of ash. The break-blocks are made of willow, and
usually last about ten weeks’ work. Adjoining this congregation
of carriages is a smith’s shop, containing twenty-eight forges and
a tire-oven; above which we found a large store-room filled with
lace-trimming, horse-hair, superfine cloth, varnished oil-cloth,
nails, rugs, and, among a variety of other requirements, plateglass
for windows. We observed that those for the front glasses
of coupés—in order to enable them to resist the occasional pelting
of hot cinders from the engine—were half an inch thick!
There was also, in an adjoining store, a collection of old cushions,
mercilessly indented and worn out by some description of dull
heavy pressure.</p>

<p>2. The hospital of the Coach Department at Crewe is an
enormous shed, 600 feet long by 180 broad. It is capable of
holding 90 carriages, with ample room for working around them,
but only 80 were under repair. Among them we observed
several flying post-offices and tenders bearing the Royal arms.
Adjoining is a large smith’s shop, also a spacious yard containing
a heavy stock of timber piled under sheds, with an office for
recording the daily amount received and delivered. On entering
“<em>the Grease house</em>,” which, contrary to expectation, we found to
be as clean as a dairy, we perceived, standing against the walls,
three huge casks of Russia tallow, a quantity of yellow palm-oil,
several boxes of soda, and a water-cock. On the opposite side
there was a small steam-boiler for heating two open cauldrons
and two wooden cooling-vats. This apparatus is constructed for
the fabrication of that yellow mixture which our readers have
seen bestowed so generously to the axles of the carriages of every
train. We had often in vain endeavoured to ascertain its composition,
which, from the grease-master, the highest possible
authority on the subject, we at last discovered to be as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>


<ul><li>200 lbs. of Russia tallow.</li>
<li>&ensp;70 lbs. of palm-oil.</li>
<li>&ensp;20 lbs. of soda.</li>
<li>&ensp;50 gallons of water.</li>
</ul>

<p class="unindent">Besides heating the two cauldrons we have mentioned, large iron
pipes pass from the steam-boiler to the immediate vicinity of
two casks, each containing one ton of sperm-oil, which is thus
kept constantly fluid, instead of crystallizing, as it is prone to do,
during cold weather.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">A Railway Town.</span></h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Having</span> now concluded our rough sketch of the workshops of
the locomotive and coach departments at Crewe,—in both of
which the Company’s artificers and workmen toil both winter and
summer from six in the morning till half-past five in the evening,
except on Saturdays, when they leave off at four,—our readers
will, we hope, feel sufficiently interested in their welfare to
inquire, as we anxiously did, a little into their domestic history
and comforts. About a hundred yards from the two establishments
we have just left there stands a plain neat building, erected
by the Company, containing baths, hot, cold, and shower, for the
workmen, as well as for their wives and daughters, the hours
allotted for each sex being stated on a board, which bluntly
enough explains that the women may wash while the men are
working, and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>. For this wholesome luxury the charge
for each person is 1½<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr>; and although we do not just at present
recollect the exact price of yellow soap per bar, of sharp white
sand per bushel, of stout dowlas-towelling per yard, or the cost
of warming a few hundred gallons of water, yet, as we stood
gazing into one of these baths, we could not help thinking that
if that Hercules who works the steam-hammer can, on Saturday
night after his week’s toil, be scrubbed perfectly clean and white
for three half-pence, he can have no very great reason to complain,
for surely, except by machinery, the operation could
scarcely be effected much cheaper! To a medical man the
Company gives a house and a surgery, in addition to which he
receives from every unmarried workman 1<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> per week; if
married, but with no family, 1½<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> per week; if married, and
with a family, 2<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> per week; for which he undertakes to give
attendance and medicine to whatever men, women, children, or
babies of the establishment may require them. A clergyman,
with an adequate salary from the Company, superintends three
large day-schools for about three hundred boys, girls, and infants.
There is also a library and mechanic’s institute, supported by a
subscription of about 10<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr> a year, at which a number of very
respectable artificers, whose education when young was neglected,
attend at night to learn, <i lang="la">ab initio</i>, reading, writing, and arithmetic.
There is likewise a vocal and instrumental class, attended
by a number of workmen, with their wives and daughters.</p>

<p>The town of Crewe contains 514 houses, one church, three
schools, and one town-hall, all belonging to the Company; and
as the birth, growth, and progress of a railway town is of novel
interest, our readers will, we think, be anxious to learn at what
speed our railway stations are now turning into towns, just as
many of our ancient post-houses formerly grew into post towns.
Although the new houses at Crewe were originally built solely
for railway servants, yet it was soon found necessary to construct
a considerable number for the many shopkeepers and others who
were desirous to join the new settlement, and accordingly, of
the present population of 8000, about one-half are strangers.
Not only are the streets, which are well lighted by gas, much
broader than those of Wolverton, but the houses are, generally
speaking, of a superior description, and, although all are new, yet
it is curious to observe how insidiously old customs, old fashions,
old wants, and even old luxuries, have become domiciled. Many
of the shops have large windows, which eagerly attempt to look
like plate-glass. In the shoemakers’ shops, contrasted with thick
railway boots and broad railway shoes, there hang narrow-soled
Wellingtons and Bluchers, as usual scarcely half the gauge or
breadth of the human foot. The Company’s workmen began by
having a cheap stout dancing-master of their own; but the aristocracy
of Crewe very naturally requiring higher kicks, we found
a superior and more elegant artist giving lessons in the town-hall—a
splendid room capable of containing 1000 persons.</p>

<p>It would of course be quite irregular for 8000 persons to live
together without the luxury of being enabled occasionally to bite
and tickle each other with the sharp teeth and talons of the law,
and accordingly we observed, appropriately inscribed in large
letters on the door of a very respectable looking house,</p>

<p class="center">
GRIFFIN, <span class="smcap">Attorney</span>.<br>
</p>

<p>Mankind are so prone to draw distinctions where no real differences
exist, that among our readers there are probably many who
conceive that, although they themselves are fully competent to
enjoy Fanny Kemble’s readings from Shakspeare, such a mental
luxury would be altogether out of character at <em>New Crewe</em>! In
short, that shops full of smiths and other varieties of workmen
(particularly him of the steam-hammer, and most especially the
artificer we saw squatted in the boiler), although all exceedingly
useful in their ways, could not possibly appreciate the delicate
intonations of voice or the poetical beauties to which we have
alluded. Now, without the smallest desire to oppose this theory,
we will simply state, that while, during the men’s dinner-hour,
we were strolling through the streets of Crewe, we observed on
the walls of a temporary theatre, surrounded by a crowd of
gaping mouths and eager unwashed faces, a very large placard,
of which the following is a <span class="lock">copy:—</span></p>

<p class="p2 unindent">The town and shops of Crewe are well lighted by gas from the
Company’s works, which create about 30,000 cubic feet per day—the
foot-paths of the streets being of asphalt, composed of the
Company’s coal-tar mixed up with gravel and ashes from the
workshops. The town is governed by a council of fifteen members,
two-thirds of whom are nominated by the workmen and
inhabitants, and one-third by the directors. Their regulations
are all duly promulgated “by order of the council.”</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Electric Telegraph.</span></h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">In</span> strolling down Lothbury, in the City of London, the stranger
suddenly sees, opposite to the dull dead wall of the Bank of England
and pointing down an alley, the forefinger of a little black
hand, under which are written the following <span class="lock">words:—</span></p>

<p class="center">
“<span class="smcap">To the Central Telegraph Station</span>.”<br>
</p>

<p>and accordingly, at the bottom of the small <i lang="la">cul-de-sac</i> there it
stands, appropriately designated by its “Electric Clock.”</p>

<p>On entering the door of this establishment the visitor suddenly
finds himself in a very handsome reception-hall, 53 feet
long, 32 broad, and 45 feet high, illuminated from above by a
skylight, which also gives light to three galleries, one above
another, communicating with the various departments of the
establishment.</p>

<p>Across this reception-hall, on the left of which are the secretary’s
and accountant’s offices, there is at each side a long counter
or table, that on the right being divided by green curtains into
six desks, at which are to be seen the round, stout, slight, slim
backs of persons of all shapes, and occasionally of both sexes,
intently occupied in writing—unseen by each other—the important
communications they are severally desirous to despatch.
These messages are required to be written on a half-sheet of
large-sized letter-paper, nearly one half of which is pre-occupied
by a printed form, to be filled up by the name and address of the
writer, as also of the person to whom his communication is addressed;
the charge of the message, answer, porterage, or cab-hire;
the date and hour at which the message is received; and
lastly, the date and hour at which the operation of conveying it
was commenced and finished by the person who works the
electric instrument.</p>

<p>On glancing at these forms our first impression was that the
space allotted for the letter or message was insufficient. It is,
however, practically found that the Company’s charges, which

<p class="unindent">seriously admonish writers of all descriptions to be as brief as
possible: indeed it is a very curious fact in natural philosophy
that a lawyer under the Company’s galvanic influence is suddenly
gifted with a description of <em>clairvoyance</em> which enables
him to write on any subject in a laconic style, which in his
chambers he would consider, and would most conscientiously
assure his client, to be utterly impracticable!</p>

<p>As fast as these messages are written, they are, one after
another, passed through a glass window to a small compartment,
or rather department, on the ground-floor, termed “<em>the Booking-office</em>,”
where, after having been briefly noted and marked with
their distinctive numbers, they are by the same hand put into a
small box, a bell is then rung, and at the same instant up they
fly, through a sort of wooden chimney, to the attic regions of the
building, to “<em>the Instrument department</em>;” and as we slowly
followed them by a staircase, on every landing-place of which
we involuntarily paused for a moment or two to reflect on the
wonderful process we were about to witness, we own it was with
admiration and surprise that, on entering the attic, we suddenly
saw before us the simple materials with which such astonishing
effects are produced.</p>

<p>In most of our manufactories it may but too truly be said
that “the workmanship exceeds the materials.” Before a common
coffin-nail can be made, the bowels of the earth must be
ransacked, ores raised in Cornwall must be smelted in Wales by
coals which have been excavated, raised, carted, recarted, &amp;c.
The amount of labour which has been expended in the fabrication
of every trifling commodity exhibited in our shops is in a similar
manner almost incalculable: indeed if our countrywomen did
but know how many hours of unwholesome and unremitting
application have been required, nay, how many constitutions
have been ruined, in the fabrication of the light beautiful dresses
and trinkets that adorn their persons, they would surely feel that
their dance, delightful as it may have appeared to them, has been
that of death to many of the poorest of their sex. Even the
tedious details of the trifling volume we are writing prove that,
while the public are luxuriously flying along the rails of only
one arterial railway, an army of upwards of ten thousand workmen
are labouring in a variety of ways for the management, protection,
and maintenance of the way; and as we were not insensible
of the usual necessity for these details, we certainly did
expect to find that a proportionate amount of labour would be
requisite for the simultaneous transmission of messages with
extraordinary velocity to distances from one to upwards of four
hundred miles. Simplicity, however, is the characteristic of
science, and certainly the attics or garrets of the London Central
Telegraph Station strikingly illustrate the truth of the axiom:
indeed the whole of the Company’s stock in trade which we
found therein consisted of four or five intelligent-looking boys,
from fourteen to fifteen years of age, and eight little “<em>instruments</em>,”
each about half the size of those which German women
and Italian men carry on their backs through our streets; and as
our advertising horse-dealers, in offering, or, as it is technically
termed, in <em>chaunting</em> their cob to the notice of “a heavy timid
gentleman,” invariably assure him “that a child can ride it,” so
it may truly be said of the electric telegraph, which transmits its
intelligence at the incomprehensible rate of 280,000 miles <em>per
second</em>, that <em>a boy can guide it</em>!</p>

<p>Although the ordinary rate at which electric communication
is now effected has above been easily expressed by a few figures,
it is evident that it is a velocity which the human mind has not
power to comprehend.</p>

<p class="unindent">how little did our immortal bard think that this light, fanciful
offer of “a fairy” to “the king of the fairies,” would, in the
19th century, not only be substantially realised, but surpassed
as follows.</p>

<p>The electric telegraph would convey intelligence more than
twenty-eight thousand times round the earth while Puck, at his
vaunted speed, was crawling round it only <em>once</em>!</p>

<p>On every instrument there is a dial, on which is inscribed the
names of the six or eight stations with which it usually communicates.
When much business is to be transacted, a boy is
necessary for each of these instruments; generally, however, one
lad can without practical difficulty manage about three; but
as the whole of them are ready for work by night as well as by
day, they are incessantly attended in watches of eight hours each
by these satellite boys by day, and by men at night.</p>

<p>As fast as the various messages for delivery, flying one after
another from the ground floor up the chimney, reach the level
of the instruments, they are brought by the superintendent to
the particular one by which they are to be communicated, and
its boy, with the quickness characteristic of his age, then instantly
sets to work.</p>

<p>His first process is, by means of the electric current, to sound
a little bell, which simultaneously alarms all the stations on his
line; and although the attention of the sentinel at each is thus
attracted, yet it almost instantly evaporates from all excepting
from that to the name of which he causes the index needle to
point, by which signal the clerk at that station instantly knows
that the forthcoming message is addressed solely to <em>him</em>, and
accordingly by a corresponding signal he announces to the
London boy that he is ready to receive it. By means of a brass
handle affixed to the dial, which the boy grasps in each hand,
he now begins rapidly to spell off his information by certain
twists of his wrists, each of which imparts to the needles on his
dials, as well as to those on the dials of his distant correspondent,
a convulsive movement designating the particular letter of the
telegraphic alphabet required.</p>

<p>By this arrangement he is enabled to transmit an ordinary sized
word in three seconds, or about twenty per minute. In case
of any accident to the wire of one of his needles, he can, by a
different alphabet, transmit his message by a series of movements
of the single needle at the reduced rate of about eight or nine
words per minute.</p>

<p>While a boy at one instrument is thus occupied in transmitting
to—say Liverpool—a message written by its London author
in ink which is scarcely dry, another boy at the adjoining
instrument is, by the reverse of the process, attentively reading
the quivering movements of his dial, which by a sort of St.
Vitus’s dance are rapidly spelling to him a message, <i>viâ</i> the
wires of the South-Western Railway, say from Gosport, which
word by word he repeats aloud to an assistant, who, seated by his
side, writes it down (he receives it about as fast as his attendant
can conveniently write it) on a sheet of paper, which as soon
as the message is concluded descends to the “Booking Office;”
where, inscribed in due form, it is without delay despatched to its
destination by messenger, cab, or express, according to order.
The following trifling anecdotes will not only practically exemplify
the process we have just described, but will demonstrate
the rapidity with which the Company are enabled to transmit
messages.</p>

<p>Some little time ago, a gentleman, walking into the reception-hall
of the London office, stated that he had important business
to communicate to his friend at Edinburgh, who by appointment
was, he knew, at that moment waiting there to reply to it in the
Company’s Telegraphic Office. On being presented with the
half-sheet of paper, headed with its printed form as described,
he wrote his query, which, after passing through the glass
window to “the Booking Office,” flew upwards to the Instrument
department, from whence with the utmost despatch it was
transmitted to Edinburgh, and, the brief reply almost instantly
returning to the instrument, it was committed to writing, and
then lowered down to the “gentleman in waiting,” who thus
quietly walked off with his answer, which we were informed at
the office he obtained within the space of five minutes, a considerable
portion of which had been consumed by himself and his
friend in writing the few words which had passed between them,
for, during their passage and return, the electric wires had only
detained them exactly the three hundred and fiftieth part of one
second!</p>

<p>In a dull foggy day an engine on the London and North-Western
Railway, tired of idly standing still with its steam up,
suddenly ran away, and, without any one to guide it, proceeded
at a rapid rate towards the Euston Station, where every one
who witnessed its start expected it would create an amount of
damage almost incalculable: but the electric telegraph, soon
overtaking and passing the fugitive, conveyed intelligence to
Camden Station in abundant time for full preparations to be made
there for its reception, by turning the points of the rails into a
sideway containing only a few ballast waggons.</p>

<p>In like manner a “gentleman” who had taken for himself and
his family only second-class tickets, but who with them had been
comfortably enjoying a first-class carriage, was greatly astonished
on arriving at his destination to see standing at the window of
his carriage, almost before the train had stopped, the Company’s
station clerk, who very loudly said to him, in presence of his
fellow-travellers, “<cite><span class="lock">Mr. ——,</span> I’ll trouble you for excess of
fare for yourself and party</cite>!”</p>

<p>Besides the transmission of <em>private</em> messages at charges averaging,
say one-fortieth of a penny per mile per word, the Electric
Telegraph Company have, in central situations in the principal
towns of the kingdom, established stations, whence and where
information, messages, and despatches of a public character may
be forwarded and received to and from all the other stations of
the Company.</p>

<p>In each of these stations a room for subscribers has been established,
in which is posted as fast as it arrives all intelligence of
commercial or public interest; such, for instance, <span class="lock">as—</span></p>


<ul>
<li>Prices of Funds and Shares.</li>

<li>Money-market.</li>

<li>Wind and Weather from about forty different parts of the kingdom.</li>

<li>Shipping arrivals and departures.</li>

<li>Losses and disasters at sea.</li>

<li>Sporting intelligence.</li>

<li>Corn-market.</li>

<li>Corn averages.</li>

<li>Cattle-market.</li>

<li>Haymarket.</li>

<li>Meat-market.</li>

<li>Coal, tallow, cotton, and iron markets.</li>

<li>General-Produce market.</li>

<li>General news of the day.</li>

<li>Parliamentary news during the Session.</li>
</ul>

<p>It need hardly be stated that this intelligence is principally
imparted to the various stations from London, where it is concentrated
by telegraphic announcements from all quarters.</p>

<p>The “Intelligence Department,” which is distinct from the
“Private Message Department,” is solely for supplying news to
the country subscription-rooms at Edinburgh, Glasgow, Liverpool,
Leeds, Manchester, Hull, Newcastle, &amp;c.</p>

<p>At 7 in the morning the superintendent of the former department
obtains all the London morning newspapers, from which he
condenses and despatches to the several electric stations the intelligence
he considers most useful to each. The local press of
course awaits the arrival, and thus by 8 o’clock <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> a merchant
at Manchester receives intelligence which the rails can only
bring at ¼ before 2, and which cannot by rail reach Edinburgh
till ½ past 9 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<p>To Glasgow is transmitted every evening detailed intelligence
for immediate insertion in the ‘North British Daily Mail,’
giving everything of importance that has occurred since the first
edition of the London papers. Similar intelligence is despatched
to papers at Hull and Leeds.</p>

<p>By this rapid transmission of intelligence, the alternations in
the prices of the markets at Manchester, &amp;c. &amp;c., being almost
simultaneous with those of London, the merchants of the former
are saved from being victimized by the latter. It is true that
by great exertions prior intelligence may electrically be sent by
private message; but as the wary ones cautiously wait for the
despatch of the Telegraph Office, it has but little effect.</p>

<p>At one o’clock information is sent to all the electric reading-rooms
of the London quotations of funds and shares up to that
hour, thus showing the actual prices at which business has been
done. The closing prices of the French funds for the day preceding
are usually annexed, and the state of the London wind
and weather at that hour.</p>

<p>Early in the morning the instrument boys are to be seen
greedily devouring (for, with the curiosity, eagerness, and enthusiasm
of youth, they appear to take great interest in their duties)
the various matters which from all quarters at once are imparted
to them.</p>

<p>One has just received intelligence by telegraph from Ely,
announcing the result of the Lynn election. Another, a copy
of a ‘Moniteur’ extraordinary, containing the first message of the
President of the French Republic to the President of the National
Assembly.</p>

<p>Another, that “Stewart’s and Hetton’s were nineteen and sixpence.
Gosforth eighteen shill. Holywell fifteen and sixpence.
Hastings Hartley fourteen and ninepence. S Q—market
one hun. fifty one, sold one hun and three—S Q.
Market very good—P Q.”</p>

<p>Another, the following characteristic description of the winds
and weather of Old England at <span class="lock">9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>:—</span></p>

<p class="unindent">The above description of our changeable climate, it occurred
to us, would not very incorrectly represent the present political
state of Europe.</p>

<p>During the day telegraphic information flashes upon these
boys <em>from the</em> <span class="smcap">Stock Exchange</span>, informing them of “prices and
closing prices of the funds and principal railway shares. With
remarks.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From the London Cattle Market</span>, stating “the number
and quality of beasts, sheep, calves, pigs. <em>Holland</em> beasts, sheep,
calves. <em>Danish</em> beasts. With remarks.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From the Meat Market</span>, stating “the prices of every description
of meat, with remarks.”</p>

<p>Also similar returns from all the other markets we have enumerated.</p>

<p>As fast as this incongruous mass of intelligence arrives, it is, in
the mode already described, transcribed in writing to separate
sheets of paper, which are without delay one after another lowered
down to the superintendent of “<em>the Intelligence Department</em>,”
by whom they are rapidly digested for distribution either to the
whole of the Company’s reading-room stations, or for those lines
only which any particular species of information may partially
interest; such as corn-markets requiring corn intelligence; seaports,
shipping news, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>As quickly as these various despatches are concocted, the
information they respectively contain reascends through “the
lift,” or wooden chimney, to the instrument department, from
whence it is projected, or rather radiates, to its respective destination;
and thus in every one of the Company’s reading-rooms
throughout the kingdom there consecutively appears, in what
would until very lately have been considered magic writing upon
the walls, the varied information which had only reached London
from all points of the compass <em>a few minutes ago</em>! But not
only does this wonderful power, which it has pleased the Almighty
to develop to mankind, facilitate in a most extraordinary degree
our communication with each other, and thereby materially adds
to our wealth, but it affords us a proportionate increase of power
to defend that property which, by integrity and industry, our
nation has, under Providence, been enabled to acquire.</p>

<p>In case of war, our Commander-in-Chief would not only be
made acquainted with information even of the smallest importance
as soon as, or even before, it reached our shores, but he would
simultaneously be enabled to issue orders to the troops at every
station in the kingdom as rapidly as if they were all assembled
on the parade before him.</p>

<p>In like manner the Admiralty would receive intelligence and
despatch directions, which, in combination with the arrangements
at the Horse Guards, War Office, and Home Office,
would give to our naval, military, and civil forces a combined
strength which it has hitherto been impracticable for them separately
to develop.</p>

<p>But to whatever amount the electric telegraph, used in the
manner we have described, may facilitate the commerce and
strengthen the defences of the empire, there remains to be delineated
an application of the discovery which, there can be no
doubt, forms the most extraordinary feat which the ingenuity of
man has hitherto performed.</p>

<p>In a corner of one of the attics in which the eight electric
instruments are placed there stands a small very ordinary-looking
piece of cheap machinery composed of a few wheels,
giving revolution to a small cylinder, upon which there has
been wound a strip of bluish paper half an inch wide and about
60 yards in length.</p>

<p>As this insignificant thread of paper slowly unrolls itself, the
stranger observes, with feelings of curiosity rather than of surprise,
that as it passes along a small flat surface it receives from
a little piece of steel wire about a quarter of an inch long, and
about the size of a large needle, a series of minute black marks,
composed of “dot and go one,”—two dots,—two dots and a line,—two
lines and a dot,—three little lines and a dot,—and so on.</p>

<p>Now many of our readers will, no doubt, gravely exclaim,
<cite>But who makes these dots?</cite></p>

<p>The answer in a few words explains the greatest mechanical
wonder upon earth. The little dots and lines marked upon the
narrow roll of paper revolving in a garret of the London Central
Telegraph Station, are made <span class="smcap">by a man sitting in Manchester</span>,
who, by galvanic electricity, and by the movement of a little brass
finger-pedal, is not only communicating to, but is <span class="allsmcap">HIMSELF</span> actually
<span class="smcap">printing in London</span> information which requires nothing but a
knowledge of the dotted alphabet he uses to be read by any one
to whom it may either publicly or confidentially be addressed!!</p>

<p>Upon this fact comment is unnecessary. It humbles rather
than exalts the mind. Of such an invention it can only be said</p>

<p class="center" lang="la">
“<span class="smcap">Non nobis, Domine, sed nomini tuo da gloriam.</span>”<br>
</p>

<p>To supply this instrument with paper there has been invented
one of the most beautiful little toys we ever beheld, consisting
of two iron fluted rollers four feet long, which, by revolving
against each other, draw between them on one side, and
emit from the other in a shower of fantastic writhing shreds, a
hundred strips of paper half an inch broad at a time.</p>

<p>Before leaving the attics in which the electric printing as well
the eight telegraphic instruments are stationed, we may observe
that the boys who work the latter form that amount of acquaintance
with the workers of the distant instruments with which they
have been in the habit of communicating, that, if from any reason
their usual correspondents are removed, they instantly discover by
the movement of the needles that they have to form an acquaintance
with a new comrade, from whom, in leisure moments, they probably
soon ascertain the fate of the old one; indeed, so completely
is this description of acquaintance established, that it is not
uncommon to hear a telegraph boy in the London attic suddenly
exclaim, as he looks with joy at the quivering vibrations of his
needles, which are working say from Manchester, “<cite>Oh! here is
Bill * * * come back!</cite>” There are, of course, however, exceptions
to these kindly feelings, and accordingly two clerks who had
been employed at remote stations on the * * * line were
lately separated because they were constantly electrically quarrelling
and abusing each other by telegraph.</p>

<p>The working of these instruments requires, as may be supposed,
undivided attention, and accordingly there is very properly
affixed to the wall of the chamber in which they stand the following
notice, which we implicitly <span class="lock">obeyed:—</span></p>

<p>“<i>Do not interrupt the clerks while engaged at the instruments.</i>”<br>
</p>

<p>As the Vicar of Wakefield’s most important movements in
life were “from the blue bed to the brown one,” so we must now
request our readers to migrate with us from the attics of the
Electric Telegraph Office to a low, dark, groined, 5th-of-November-looking
cellar, thirty-two feet long by five in width,
containing three shelves, on which are to be seen, lying in double
rows, thirty-four galvanic batteries, or, to speak in more homely
terms, small open troughs, five inches broad, and either thirty-two
inches or twenty inches in length. The largest, weighing,
when charged, 60 lbs., are called “twenty-fours,” because they
contain that number of pairs of plates of copper and zinc separated
by a little sand, the whole being then brought into galvanic
action by being sluiced with sulphuric acid and water mixed in
the proportions of one of the former to twelve of the latter.</p>

<p>The smallest, called “twelves,” contain only that number of
pairs of plates.</p>

<p>Of these batteries it requires from four to six of the largest to
be applied to one instrument to blow a message from London
to Edinburgh. A single “twelve,” applied to each instrument,
will project intelligence to a range of four or five miles.</p>

<p>These batteries are connected with the eight instruments in
the attics by small copper wires, which, to prevent confusion of
action from contact one with another, are covered with cotton
thread, saturated with a mixture of tar, rosin, and grease.</p>

<p>With this simple precaution, nine wires, insulated from each
other, are packed in a half-inch leaden tube, in which they again
descend from the instruments to the cellar region. Four or five
of these pipes are there packed into an iron pipe three inches in
diameter, which conducts them under the foot pavement of the
streets to the termini of the arterial rail-roads, alongside of which,
and in the open air, a series of lines resembling those on which
music is written, composed of galvanised iron, stout enough to
bear tension, and suspended by posts, have, as is well known,
been constructed. Along the street pavement, at every quarter
of a mile, there are cast-iron “<em>testing-posts</em>” to enable the Company’s
servants to examine all these wires in order to detect
and remove any that require to be renewed.</p>

<p>Although the London police have strict orders to allow no
one to impede the thoroughfare of the public, and accordingly
are everlastingly mumbling the unphilosophical monotonous
exhortation of “<cite>Get on, Sir!</cite>” “<cite>Move on, Ma’am!</cite>” yet it is
almost impossible for any ruminating being to walk the streets
without occasionally pausing to reflect not only on the busy
bustling scenes which glide before his eyes, but on those which,
at very different rates, are at the same moment flowing beneath
his feet.</p>

<p>In our metropolis, there is scarcely a street which does not
appear to take pride in exposing as often as possible to public
view a series of pipes of all sizes, in which fire of various companies,
pure water of various companies, and unmentionable
mixtures, abominable to all, pass cheek by jowl with infinitely
less trouble than the motley human currents flow above them.
But among all the subterranean pipes laid bare before us there is
certainly no one which has more curious contents than the three-inch
iron pipe of the Electric Telegraph Company; and yet, of
all the multitudes who walk the streets, how few of them ever
care to reflect what a singular contrast exists between the slow pace
at which they themselves are proceeding, and the rate at which
beneath their feet forty-five electric wires are transmitting in all
directions, and to a variety of distances, intelligence of every
possible description!</p>

<p>How singular is it to reflect that, within the narrow space of
the three-inch iron pipe which encases them, notice of a murder is
flying to London papers, passing news from India going into the
country; along another wire an officer is applying for his regimentals,
while others are conducting to and fro the “price of
stocks,” “news of the Pope,” a speech from Paris of the “collapsed
poet,” &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. In case, from the abrasion of the
cotton that surrounds the numerous copper wires within the
pipe, any of them come into contact with each other, the intelligence
which each is conveying is suddenly confounded; in
which case other wires must instantly be substituted. Indeed,
even as regards the strong galvanised iron wires which in the
open air run parallel with our arterial railways, if in wet
weather, in spite of the many ingenious precautions taken, the
rain should form a continuous stream between the several wires
and the ground, the electric fluid, escaping from the wires, is
conducted by the water till it “finds earth,” the best of all
conductors; and therefore, instead of the intelligence going on,
say to Edinburgh, it follows the axiom of electricity by selecting
the shortest road, and, thus completing its circuit through the
earth, it returns to London. Sometimes, instead of going “to
earth,” it flies back to the office in London along another
wire, to which, by means of a continuous line of water or of
entanglement of the two wires, it has managed to escape; in
which case, the messages on both wires wrangling with each
other, the communication is stopped.</p>

<p>It is commonly asserted and believed that many birds are
killed by merely perching upon the iron wires of the electric
telegraph; but at any time they can do so with perfect impunity.
If, indeed, a bird could put one of his feet on the wire, and with
the other manage to touch the earth, he would then, no doubt,
be severely galvanised. That the railway company’s men often
pick up under the wires of the electric telegraph partridges and
other birds which have evidently been just killed—indeed, some
are found with their heads cut off—is quite true; but these
deaths and decapitations have proceeded, not from electricity,
but from the birds—probably during twilight or fog—having at
full speed flown against the wires, which, of course, cut <em>their</em>
heads off, just as an iron bar would cut off the head of any man
or alderman on horseback who, at a full gallop, was to run foul
of it.</p>

<p>In windy weather the electric wires form an Eolian harp,
which occasionally emits most unearthly music. “<cite>I say, Jack!</cite>”
said an engine-driver to his stoker, who, like himself, was listening
for the first time to this querulous sort of noise proceeding
from the newly erected wires along his line, “<cite>I say, Jack!
ain’t they a giving it to ’em at Thrapstone?</cite>”</p>

<p>When the posts and wires of the electric telegraph between
Northampton and Peterborough were being erected, an honest
farmer, who for many minutes had very attentively been watching
the operation, inquired of the chief superintendent to what
use it was to be applied? On being informed that by its means
he would in a few minutes receive <em>at Wellingboro’</em> a list of the
Mark Lane prices <em>in London</em>, he evidently incredulously asked
how that was to be done; and on its being explained to him
that the intelligence would be sent down to him “<em>letter by
letter</em>,” he exclaimed, “But you don’t mean to say that, besides
letters, it will bring down <em>parcels</em> too?”</p>

<p>As the rails and electric wires are now immediately before us,
we cannot refrain from observing that the two inventions, like all
branches of science, not only materially assist each other, but that
the former, to a considerable degree, has created the latter: for
instance, it may be truly said that Mr. M‘Adam materially assisted
the invention of the innumerable little four-wheeled carriages
which burst into existence as soon as, in consequence of good roads,
it became possible for a single horse to draw a whole family. In
like manner, it may, we submit, be reasonably and fairly asserted
that the gradients and police of the railway have materially assisted
the invention, or rather the application, of galvanic electricity to
wires, which, placed along unguarded high roads, would have
been practically useless.</p>

<p>On the outside of the Central Telegraph Station, as well as
in the interior, there is an electric clock, the latter of which is
worked by a small battery contained in a white jar capable of
holding about three quarts, and, the pendulum being operated
upon by combined electricity with galvanism, the clock requires
no winding up, and would, therefore, go perpetually, or rather
as long as the battery lasts; and if the Company would, instead
of gas-burners, adopt the electric light, their establishment would
then, <i lang="la">sui generis</i>, be complete.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Considerable instruction, with some little amusement, might,
no doubt, be derived from a perusal of the variegated information,
intelligence, and ordinary as well as extraordinary private
messages which have been despatched and recorded by the electric
telegraph; but the Company very properly faithfully refuse—be
it important or unimportant—to unveil to any one what they
consider to have been confidentially intrusted to their care.</p>

<p>Those, however, who have recourse to the invention often
divulge their own secrets; and accordingly here is one which
came to us direct from one of the parties concerned.</p>

<p>During a marriage which very lately took place at ——,
one of the bridesmaids was so deeply affected by the ceremony,
that she took the opportunity of the concentrated interest excited
by the bride to elope from the church with an admirer. The
instant her parents discovered their sad loss, messengers were
sent to all the railway stations to stop the fugitives. The telegraph
also went to work, and with such effect that, before night,
no less than four affectionate couples legitimately married that
morning were interrupted on their several marriage jaunts, and
most seriously bothered, inconvenienced, and impeded by policemen
and magistrates, who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Like envious clouds seem’d bent to dim their glory,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And check their bright course to the Occident.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, when it is considered that young people
who form imprudent attachments, instead of being effectually
separated, as in old-fashioned times, by distance, can now-a-days,
though four or five hundred miles apart, at any moment,
by daylight or by moonlight, electrically converse with each
other—in short, ask questions and give answers—it must be
admitted that, although the galvanic telegraph has certainly
triumphantly succeeded in stopping many matches, it has possibly,
if the real truth could be known, made quite as many as it
has marred.</p>

<p>With respect, however, to communications of this delicate
nature, we deem it our duty very gravely to warn our young
readers, especially those of the fairer sex, that unless London
time were to be adopted—as it is—at all the electric stations, a
despatch would arrive at its western destination at an earlier
hour than that at which it had left its eastern starting-post;
and thus a young lady might appear to have affirmatively
answered in Devonshire an important question—say seven minutes
and a half before, according to local clocks, it had actually been
proposed to her in London!</p>

<p>In cases where crimes have been committed, the astonishing
detective powers of the telegraph have already proved most
valuable to the community. As, however, the numberless instances
which might be cited are but endless exemplifications of
the same principle, we will merely offer to our readers the fragment
of one of them.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>He never expected that!… He had made
up his mind to give her the stuff,—he had deliberately bought
it,—had paid for it,—had put it into his pocket,—had driven
with it to the terminus of the Great Western Railway,—had
flown with it along the line to Slough,—had walked with it to
the cottage.</p>

<p>He had already deprived the poor creature of her character,
and now, on the first day of the year 1845, he had come down
to her on purpose to deprive her of her life.</p>

<p>With affected kindness he had offered her refreshment,—had
waited while, with his money, she went to buy it,—he
had summoned up courage? … no, cowardice and wickedness …
enough secretly to pour the stuff from a tiny phial into her
glass,—he had seen her, with feelings of gratitude to him,
raise the mixture to her faded lips,—he had watched her swallow
the first mouthful—then another—then drink,—he had expected
every instant, as she reached the drugs, to see his degraded
victim drop down dead before his eyes;—he could bear all this,
but he did not know that it was the nature of the horrid poison he
had purchased to betray the hand that administered it. Oh! he
never expected that loud, horrid, piercing, convulsive scream!</p>

<p>As terrified and scared he opened the door to escape, the
inhabitants of the neighbouring cottages, alarmed by the frightful
noise they had just heard, sympathetically opened theirs.
They saw him leave the house with hurried steps,—observed
him make for the Slough road, where by another party he was
observed to be “confused—to tremble—and on being addressed,
to make no reply.” And yet he had only done what he had
deliberately intended to perpetrate:—he knew there was no rest
for the wicked, but, Oh! he had never expected that shrill, fearful,
haunting scream!</p>

<p>On reaching the station he took his place in a departing train,
and in a few minutes he apparently had effected his escape!</p>

<p>Everybody who has travelled by the Great Western Railway
knows how joyously its well-appointed trains skim along the level
country between Slough and London. He no doubt appreciated
the speed—valued the wings with which he was flying—more
than any of his fellow-passengers. He probably felt that
no power on earth could overtake him, and that, if he could but
dive into the mass of population in London, he would in perfect
security flow with its streams unnoticed.</p>

<p>But whatever may have been his fears—his hopes—his fancies—or
his thoughts, there suddenly flashed along the wires of the
electric telegraph which were stretched close beside him the
following <span class="lock">words:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="hanging">“<span class="smcap">A murder has just been committed at Salthill, and
the suspected murderer was seen to take a first-class
ticket for London by the train which left
Slough at 7h. 42m. p.m.</span></p>

<p class="hanging">“<span class="smcap">He is in the garb of a Quaker, with a brown greatcoat
on, which reaches nearly down to his feet. he
is in the last compartment of the second first-class
carriage.”</span></p>
</div>

<p>And yet, fast as these words flew like lightning past him, the
information they contained, with all its details, as well as every
secret thought that had preceded them, had already consecutively
flown millions of times faster; indeed, at the very instant
that, within the walls of the little cottage at Slough, there had
been uttered that dreadful scream, it had simultaneously reached
the judgment-seat of Heaven!</p>

<p>On arriving at the Paddington Station, after mingling for
some moments with the crowd, he got into an omnibus, and as
it rumbled along, taking up one passenger and putting down
another, he probably felt that his identity was every minute
becoming confounded and confused by the exchange of fellow-passengers
for strangers that was constantly taking place. But
all the time he was thinking, the Cad of the omnibus—a policeman
in disguise—knew that he held his victim like a rat in a cage.
Without, however, apparently taking the slightest notice of him,
he took one sixpence, gave change for a shilling, handed out this
lady, stuffed in that one, until, arriving at the Bank, the guilty man,
stooping as he walked towards the carriage-door, descended the
steps;—paid his fare;—crossed over to the Duke of Wellington’s
statue, where pausing for a few moments, anxiously to gaze
around him, he proceeded to the Jerusalem Coffee House,—thence
over London Bridge to the Leopard Coffee House in
the Borough,—and finally to a lodging-house in Scott’s Yard,
Cannon Street.</p>

<p>He probably fancied that, by making so many turns and
doubles, he had not only effectually puzzled all pursuit, but that his
appearance at so many coffee-houses would assist him, if necessary,
in proving an <i lang="la">alibi</i>; but, whatever may have been his
motives or his thoughts, he had scarcely entered the lodging
when the policeman—who, like a wolf, had followed him every
step of the way—opening his door, very calmly said to him—the
words no doubt were infinitely more appalling to him even
than the scream that had been haunting <span class="lock">him—</span></p>

<p class="center">
“<span class="smcap">Hav’nt you just come from Slough?</span>”<br>
</p>

<p class="unindent">The monosyllable “NO,” confusedly uttered in reply, substantiated
his guilt.</p>

<p>The policeman made him his prisoner;—he was thrown into
jail;—tried;—found guilty of wilful murder;—and—<span class="allsmcap">HANGED</span>.</p>

<p>A few months afterwards, we happened to be travelling by
rail from Paddington to Slough, in a carriage filled with people
all strangers to one another. Like English travellers, they were
all mute. For nearly fifteen miles no one had uttered a single
word, until a short-bodied, short-necked, short-nosed, exceedingly
respectable-looking man in the corner, fixing his eyes on
the apparently fleeting posts and rails of the electric telegraph,
significantly nodded to us as he muttered <span class="lock">aloud—</span></p>

<p class="center">
“<span class="smcap">Them’s the cords that hung John Tawell!</span>”<br>
</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Having now concluded a rough outline of the practical working
of the electric telegraph, it is necessary that we should state—as
an important fact on which we offer no comment—that the
Company has made arrangements with all the railway companies
for working their wires, excepting with the South-Eastern, and,
accordingly, that the electric communication between London
and Dover is worked by itself, and without connexion with the
general system.</p>

<p>The wires of the electric telegraph from the various lines of

<h3><span class="smcap">Railway Clearing-House.</span></h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">It</span> is a curious fact that human ignorance, and especially good
honest homespun English ignorance, often produces important
and highly beneficial results. “<cite>If I had but known what I have
had to contend with I would never have undertaken the job</cite>,”
is a remark which many a poor emigrant, many a weary traveller,
many a journeyman labourer in every department of life, has
fervently muttered to himself. The ejaculation is particularly
applicable to the original projectors of our railways, who, had
they but known the hydra-headed difficulties which, one after
another, they would have to encounter, would most surely have
kept their money in their pockets, or, in the phraseology of the
vulgar, “would never have undertaken the job.”</p>

<p>Besides the difficulty of raising money, which during the railway
mania certainly amounted to <em>nil</em>, there were parliamentary
difficulties, engineering difficulties, difficulties of management of
various descriptions; and yet, when all these were overcome,
when each railway, with its beautiful system of committee-men,
secretaries, engineers, surveyors, station-masters, engine-drivers,
stokers, pokers, guards, police, superintendents, artificers, labourers,
&amp;c., was fully organised and completed, and every
line competent along the whole or any portion of its length
to convey with safety and due attention every description of
traffic, there suddenly appeared a new difficulty, which not only
most seriously embarrassed, but which threatened almost to prevent,
the combined action of the vertebral railways which at
such trouble and cost had just been created. The difficulty
alluded to was what is now commonly called “the <em>through</em>
traffic.”</p>

<p>Even before the railway system came into full operation, it was
soon found, that to conciliate, or rather to satisfy the just claims
of the passenger public, it would be necessary not to harass warm
“through” travellers by forcing them to migrate to cold carriages
as often as, asleep or awake, dozing or dreaming, they
reached each terminus of the various railway companies who, in
enmity rather than in partnership, were the proprietors of the
consecutive portions of the thoroughfare line.</p>

<p>Again, it was soon found that our merchants and manufacturers
as justly insisted rather than requested that their goods and
merchandise should go “<em>through</em>” to their destinations without
being subjected to the delay and serious injury which were
unavoidable in repeatedly unpacking and repacking them into
fresh waggons. Lastly, it was found that, for cattle and horses,
changes of carriages were equally objectionable. The will of
the people becoming, therefore, in these instances, the law of the
rails, passengers, parcels, goods, horses, and cattle, were, generally
speaking, carried “<em>through</em>” without change of carriage.</p>

<p>But though the traveller, the receiver of the parcel, of the
package, of the horse, dog, bullock, sheep, or pig, after paying
for the fare, of course cared not the hundred-thousandth part of a
farthing what was done with the money, yet it will be self-evident
that he left behind him sources of endless vexation and almost
unpreventible disputes; for not only was the paltry fare he had
paid for his own conveyance, or that which he might have paid
for the conveyance of a lean pig, to be divided among the proprietors
of two, three, four, five, six, or seven different companies,
but of these companies all excepting one would have not only to
remunerate by a mileage allowance the company in whose carriage
or waggon, for the benefit of all parties, the traveller, or his
parcel, or his goods, or his cow, calf, horse, dog, sheep, or sow, had
been carried “through,” but an extra charge for demurrage was
evidently due to the said company for every day that its carriage
or waggon had been detained by the companies to whom it
did not belong. The railway companies between London and
York first saw the absolute necessity of their endeavouring by
some arrangement to settle accounts of this description, which
daily and hourly were growing up between them; but inasmuch
as each company, from feelings of jealous independence, kept their
books in a different form, dissensions arose, angry correspondence
followed, until the settlement of their joint accounts was impeded
by the most vexatious delays. The virulence of the disorder,
however, was the means of its cure. Mr. Morison, the present
very able manager and sole organiser of the new system, conceived
the formation of a central office, and the idea was no sooner suggested
to Mr. Glyn, the chairman of the London and North-Western
Railway, than, seeing at a glance its practical bearing,
he gave it the whole weight of his well-earned influence, and
was mainly instrumental in the establishment of the astonishing
system of minute detail which we will now endeavour very briefly
to describe.</p>

<p>The Railway Clearing-House, which adjoins the right-hand side
of the entrance-gate from Seymour Street to the Euston Station,
is under the control of a committee composed of the chairmen of
all the railway companies who are parties to the clearing arrangements;
the expense of maintaining the establishment being
divided rateably among the companies in proportion to the extent
of business transacted by it for each.</p>

<p>On opening a street door, which a brass plate beamingly
announces to be that of the “Railway Clearing-House,” the
stranger sees before him a long passage, on both sides of which
are hanging, as if for sale, a variety of very decent-looking hats,
cloaks, and coats, which he has no sooner passed than he finds
himself in a spacious hall or office 78 feet long, 20 wide, and
26 feet high, in which, at one glance, he sees seated or standing
before him, at 13 parallel desks, upwards of a hundred well-dressed
clerks, each silently occupied either in writing or in
apparently carefully investigating that which others have written.
The stillness of the scene, to which the public have no admittance,
is very remarkable; and before we enter on the subject of
the avocation of those before us, we cannot help observing that,
to any one who has lately had an opportunity of seeing the number
of half-starved men in Paris who, with interminable mustachios
and noble bushy beards, are, with depressed heads,
intently engaged in a variety of occupations, down to that of—say—painting
a tiny brooch to ornament the bosom of a lady’s
gown—it is amusing to contrast a body of such fierce-looking
warriors “<i lang="fr">à demi-solde</i>” with the plain, clean, close-shorn men
of business, who throughout the United Kingdom are, week after
week, month after month, and year after year, unassumingly
labouring in behalf of that which republicans only talk of instead
of attain—a commonwealth.</p>

<p>The business of the Railway Clearing-House is transacted by
one manager and 110 clerks. The system comprehends 47 railway
companies: in short, it extends to all railways north of the
Thames—from Bristol, London, and Harwich, to Aberdeen;
and it contains no less than 648 clearing-house stations, by the
correspondence of which with the London clearing-office the
accounts of the “through” traffic of all the companies is adjudged
and settled.</p>

<p>The aforesaid business is divided into four <span class="lock">departments:—</span></p>

<p>First, and most important, the goods and live-stock traffic.</p>

<p>Second, the coaching traffic.</p>

<p>Third, the mileage of carriages and waggons, as also the mileage
of tarpaulins for covering waggons.</p>

<p>Fourth, lost luggage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goods.</span>—From each of the 684 Railway Clearing-House
Stations which we have enumerated, there is forwarded to the
London office a “daily abstract of goods” (printed in black
ink), containing the invoice, the amount carted, the sums paid
or the sums to pay, the undercharge, the overcharge, and the
description of the traffic “<em>forwarded</em>” each day from each
station to each of the other stations enumerated in the return.
Of these goods the gross total is composed of a number of articles,
each of which, from the station from which it is forwarded, is
charged according to the established rate agreed on by the
companies for “through” goods. Some of these weights are
only 14 lbs., in which case they, as well as every package below
56 lbs. (termed “a small”), are charged at a higher rate.</p>

<p>2. From each railway clearing station there is forwarded <em>daily</em>
to the London office a return similar to the above (but for distinction
printed in red ink), of the description, weight, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
of goods <em>received</em> at each station, and thus from two opposite
points a detailed return of the amount of goods conveyed between
them is declared.</p>

<p>3. As soon as these two returns (black and red) are received
at the London office, they are carefully examined, to ascertain if
the articles returned in each are correct—that is, if the declaration
of the goods <em>despatched</em> corresponds with the return of the
same goods from the point at which they should have been received.
About 30 per cent., however, of the number of items in these
returns do <em>not</em> correspond, the difference being sometimes a few
pounds, sometimes a few pence. Ten clerks are constantly occupied
in checking these two sets of returns.</p>

<p>4. As fast as these errors are detected, a “<em>statement of omissions
and inaccuracies</em>” (in one month 7000 of these statements have
been transmitted) are sent from the London office to both parties
for explanation, and, when returned by each with “remarks,” the
errors are corrected according to their replies.</p>

<p>5. From the above accounts a division of the receipts of the
goods traffic is made monthly; and as there are 4500 of these
settlements (each on an average wanting 2½ copies), about 11,000
copies per month are required. These abstracts are for the following
object:—All “<em>through</em>” goods arriving in London are
by agreement charged with certain terminal expenses for carterage
and porterage, which are about double those charged in the
country. This monthly settlement, therefore, shows to every
company concerned what each is entitled by mileage to receive
from one or more companies,—what actually has been received
by each,—and consequently the balance due from the one to the
other. Hull alone, from its numerous connexions with other
stations, receives on an average 200 of these monthly abstracts.
Twenty-four clerks are constantly occupied in preparing them.</p>

<p>6. The next operation is, by a consideration of all these balances,
to determine what the clearing-house, as the representative
of all the creditor companies, is entitled to receive from the
debtor companies. The final result of all these operations is
exemplified by a monthly return forwarded by the office to each
of the forty-seven companies, showing separately to each, for each
of its stations, the weights, the mileage proportions, the terminal
expenses, and, lastly, the balances, whether due to it or by it, on
the traffic from each of its stations to all other clearing-house
stations to which goods had been sent, or from which received.
The number of entries in these monthly summaries averages
11,186.</p>

<p>The above closes the account of the goods traffic. Any
omission or errors in these accounts are corrected in those of the
subsequent month, the balances being, in the first instance, always
paid as declared by the London railway clearing-house.</p>

<p>When the balances are finally struck, a letter is addressed from
the office to each company, advising it of the amount due to or
by it on the traffic of the month; and, unless these balances are
paid by each company within twenty-one days, interest at 6
per cent. is charged, and credited to the companies to whom the
clearing-house is nominally indebted.</p>

<p>For the convenience of the companies a weekly notice is sent
by the London office to each, informing each of the amounts of
the receipts of the <em>through</em> goods traffic to which it is respectively
entitled. This single operation, which enables the companies
to publish their weekly receipts, employs nine clerks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Passengers.</span>—All tickets collected at all the clearing-house
stations from <em>through</em> passengers are transmitted daily to the
London clearing-house, from whence, after being examined and
compared with the returns of the tickets issued, they are sent back
to the respective companies. From Euston, as well as from all
other stations, passenger tickets for every station are each numbered
separately from 1 to 10,000, and are issued consecutively,
not only for each station, but for each <em>class</em> of passengers. In
examining these collected tickets, which on an average amount
to 9000 per day,—in comparing them with the consecutive numbers
as entered in the daily Returns received from the various stations,—and
in checking the consecutive numbers themselves, five
clerks are employed. The railway clearing-office thus <span class="lock">receives—</span></p>

<p>1. Return from Euston booking-office, as also from all clearing-house
passenger stations, stating the number of passengers of each
class booked for all clearing stations, the portions of fares paid
by each passenger and due to “foreign” companies.</p>

<p>2. From this account the London clearing-house prepares and
forwards daily to each company a return, showing the portion of
the fares received at Euston due to each respectively. The
above returns are despatched on the evening of the second day.</p>

<p>3. The London clearing-house receives daily from every clearing
station a similar return.</p>

<p>4. From these two sets of returns the debtor and creditor
account of each company is made up, and kept separate in a
book, from which a statement of balances is prepared and forwarded
weekly to each company, showing the amount received
on its account by the other companies, as also on account of the
other companies by it, the balances due to it or by it, and the
weekly balance due to or by the clearing-house on behalf of the
companies. We may here observe that by the foregoing arrangements,
without which the <em>through</em> passenger traffic could not
possibly be practically carried out, 2,700,000 persons are annually
saved the inconvenience of changing their carriage during
their journey.</p>

<p>5. The same minute process is pursued with horses, carriages,
and dogs, the tickets for which are numbered consecutively, and
checked as for passengers. In this duty thirteen clerks are
employed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parcels.</span>—The daily returns of the number of parcels despatched
and received are checked, and the balance of receipts
divided, precisely as the goods, with this addition, that a “waybill”
is sent by each train with the parcels for each station, showing
the number of the parcel, the weight, address, and charge;
similar bills being also sent from the receiving station to the
clearing-house, thus constituting an additional check. For small
parcels carried by the passenger-trains from London to Edinburgh
the gross charge of 4<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr> is divided among four companies; small
charges are often divided among seven companies; and in some
cases a charge of 6<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> is divided among two companies. In this
duty eight clerks are employed.</p>

<p>At the end of the London Clearing-House three clerks are employed
for the live-stock traffic, principally composed of lean
stock going to be fattened, of fat cattle, pigs, sheep, and calves
going to market. The rates for live stock, like those for goods,
are agreed on by all the joint companies, and the returns are
sent weekly to the clearing-house. The gross receipts, after
deducting a small sum, per waggon, for terminal expenses, are
divided, by mileage, among the companies (frequently six in
number) concerned.</p>

<p>We have now to endeavour to explain a new branch of the
department, termed “<em>Mileage Branch</em>.”</p>

<p>In 1848 no less than 443,604 loaded waggons were by various
companies (averaging three in number) sent “<em>through</em>” besides
267,228 sent back empty. The course of each of these waggons
the clearing-house had to trace, in order to ascertain the exact
time each was detained on each railway.</p>

<p>The number of miles for which the companies received, through
the London clearing-house, payment from each other, amounted
to 45,580,384.</p>

<p>The manner in which these extraordinary results are effected
is as <span class="lock">follows:—</span></p>

<p>At every junction of railways there are stationed men in the
pay of the London Clearing-House, to take the number of all
passenger-carriages and goods-waggons, as also of all tarpaulins
or sheets covering waggons. These men make to the clearing-office
<em>daily</em> a detailed statement of the same.</p>

<p>Returns are also sent <em>daily</em> from all the clearing-house stations
on all the lines of railway, by the servants of the respective companies,
of all foreign carriages arriving and departing from each
of the said stations. From these returns the London Clearing-House
is enabled to trace the course of all waggons and passenger-carriages
travelling on what are termed “foreign” lines, and to
debit and credit every company with the sums it has respectively
incurred for mileage, as also what is due from and to the respective
companies for demurrage per day of waggons or of
passenger-carriages.</p>

<p>These accounts are transmitted to each company monthly.</p>

<p>Sheets covering waggons are in like manner all checked at
the junctions by the men placed there by the London Clearing-House,
as also by returns forwarded to the office from the various
stations at which the waggon stops to be loaded or unloaded;
and thus the charge of one-tenth of a penny per mile for the
use of each of these tarred coverings is divided according to
its proper proportion among the respective companies over whose
lines it has travelled! For a waggon or carriage from Edinburgh
to London, mileage and also demurrage accounts are sent
to four companies, and from Arbroath to London to seven
companies.</p>

<p>Fourteen clerks are required to keep the mileage and demurrage
accounts of carriages and waggons, and eight clerks to keep
those of the tarpaulins or sheets,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Accountant.</span>—Lastly, in the corner of the London
office, in a small elevated compartment, about four feet square, sits
“the Accountant,” who <span class="lock">keeps—</span></p>

<p>1. An account for each separate company (forty-seven in
number), showing briefly the sums at their debits and credits, and
the balance due to or by each.</p>

<p>2. An interest ledger, showing the amount of interest accruing
on balances in arrear, which interest is received by the clearing-house
from the Dr. company, and paid to the Cr. company.</p>

<p>3. By the Act of Parliament, every railway company is bound
to pay to Government a duty on all sums received by it from
passengers, whether on its own account or for other companies.
The consequence of this is, that one company is continually
obliged to pay duty for another, thus creating a debtor and creditor
account for duties, which account the Clearing-House also
settles monthly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lost Luggage.</span>—The Clearing-House, from its connexion
with almost every railway in the kingdom, undertakes the duty
of corresponding with all the clearing-house stations from which
it receives <em>daily</em> returns respecting any unclaimed luggage left
on the rails.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the Clearing-Office, in the corner, there is a
small post-office of compartments for the letters and returns
daily transmitted by the manager to each company.</p>

<p>The office usually receives and despatches 4500 communications
per day, employing five lads to open, endorse, and arrange them.</p>

<p>The office is open daily from 9 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> till 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span></p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>With a deep sigh we can truly say that we have now concluded
a sketch of the Railway Clearing-House, which, as it gave us one
headache to investigate, and another to endeavour to explain,
will probably be equally afflicting to our readers.</p>

<p>In justice, however, to the system, we must confess that it is
impossible to convey in writing an adequate conception of the
infinity of details with which it has to grapple.</p>

<p>The number of items which in the course of a year, by the
London office, are examined, traced through many returns,
checked, and transferred from one account to another, exceeds
rather than falls short of (50,000,000) fifty millions!</p>

<p>It must be obvious to any person conversant with the working
of railways, that, without a centralised system of this description,
so constituted as to command the confidence of the railway companies,
the railway system generally would not only soon become
clogged, but constant squabbles and disagreements between the
various companies would ensue, to the detriment of their interests,
as well as to the discomfort and inconvenience of the public.</p>

<p>The true object, therefore, of the London Railway Clearing-House
is to enable the railway companies of the United Kingdom
who are parties thereto, to work that enormous traffic, in which
they have a common interest, with as much security to themselves,
and with as little inconvenience to the public, as if all the
associated companies were <span class="allsmcap">ONE</span>; and it is evident that in no way
could this important object have been effected, except by the
establishment of an office which, based on principles of complete
centralisation, should be—as the London Clearing-House really
is—independent of each company, but under the common control
of <span class="allsmcap">ALL</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Moral.</span></h3>


<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> few rough sketches which we have now concluded, insignificant
and trivial as they may appear in detail, form altogether a
mass of circumstantial evidence demonstrating the vast difficulty
as well as magnitude of the arrangements necessary for the practical
working of great railways; and yet we regret to add, in their
general management there exist moral and political difficulties
more perplexing than those which Science has overcome, or
which order has arranged.—We allude to a variety of interests,
falsely supposed to be conflicting, which it is our desire to conciliate,
and from which we shall endeavour to derive an honest
moral.</p>

<p>When the present system of railway travelling was about to be
introduced into Europe, it of course became necessary for Parliament
and for His Majesty’s Government seriously to consider
and eventually to determine whether these great national
thoroughfares should be scientifically formed, regulated, and
directed by the State, under a Board competently organized for
the purpose, or whether the conveyance of the public should be
committed to the inexperienced and self-interested management of
an infinite number of Joint-stock Companies. Without referring
to by-gone arguments in favour of each of these two systems,
and, above all, without offering a word against the decision of
Parliament on the subject, we have simply to state that the joint-stock
system was adopted, and that accordingly capitalists and
speculators of all descriptions—men of substance and men of
straw—were authorized at their own cost to create and govern
the iron thoroughfares of the greatest commercial country in the
world. The first result was what might naturally have been
expected, for no sooner was it ascertained that a railway connecting,
or, as it may be more properly termed, tapping immense
masses of population—such, for instance, as are contained in
London, Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, &amp;c.—was
productive of profit, than, just as, when one lucky man finds a rich
lode, hundreds of ignorant, foolish people immediately embark,
or, as it is too truly termed, <em>sink</em> their capital in “<em>mining</em>,” so it
was generally believed that any “<em>railway</em>”—whether it connected
cities or villages it mattered not a straw—would be equally productive.</p>

<p>The competition thus first irrationally and then insanely
created was productive of good and evil. The undertakings were
commenced with great vigour. On the other hand, as engineering
talent cannot all of a sudden be produced as easily as capital,
many important works were constructed under very imperfect
superintendence; and as iron, timber, and every article necessary
for the construction of a railway simultaneously rose in value,
the result was that the expense of these new thoroughfares,
which by the exaction of fares proportionate to their outlay
must, as we have shown,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> eventually be paid for by the public,
very greatly exceeded what, under a calm, well-regulated system,
would have been their cost. Nevertheless, in spite of all difficulties
and expenses, foreseen as well as unforeseen, our great
arterial railways were very rapidly constructed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> See Chapter <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> <a href="#CHAPTER_I">page 17</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Their managers, however, had scarcely concluded their “song
of triumph,” when they found themselves seriously embarrassed
by a demand on the part of the public for what has been rather
indefinitely termed “cheap travelling;” and as this question
involves most serious considerations, we will venture to offer a
very few observations respecting it.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that, inasmuch as it is the duty of
Parliament to legislate for the interests of the public, so it is the
duty of Her Majesty’s Government to exercise their influence
in legitimately obtaining for the community <em>cheap</em> travelling.
But although money is valuable to every man, his life is infinitely
more precious; and therefore, without stopping to inquire whether
by cheap travelling is meant travelling for nothing, for fares
unremunerative, or for fares only slightly remunerative to the
Company, we submit as a mere point of precedence, that the <em>first</em>
object the legislature ought to obtain is, that every possible
precaution shall be taken to ensure for the public <span class="allsmcap">SAFE</span> travelling.</p>

<p>Now, casting aside all petty or local interests, we calmly ask
in what manner and by what means would Her Majesty’s Government
ensure for the public <em>safe</em> travelling, supposing our railways
were the sole property of the State?</p>

<p>The answer is not only evident, but, we submit, undeniable.</p>

<p>The way, under Providence, to protect the public from avoidable
accidents on railways is, utterly regardless of expense, to
construct the rails, sleepers, locomotive-engines, and carriages of
the very best materials, carefully put together by the best workmen;
and then to intrust the maintenance of the line to engineers
and other men of science of the highest attainments,
assisted by a corps of able-bodied guards, pointsmen, and policemen,
all sober, vigilant, active, intelligent, and honest.</p>

<p>Now it is highly satisfactory to reflect that every one of the
above costly precautions, as well as all others of a similar nature
which a paternal government could reasonably desire to enforce,
are as conducive to the real interests of the proprietors of a railway
as they are to the safety of those who travel on it; for even
supposing that the Directors take no pride in maintaining the
character of the national thoroughfare committed to their charge—that,
reckless of human life, they care for nothing but their own
pockets—a railway accident summarily inflicts upon their purses
the same description of punishment instantaneously awarded to a
man who carelessly runs his head against a post. For instance,
only a few weeks ago a ballast-train on the London and North-Western
Railway having stopped for a moment, a goods-train
behind it ran into it. No one was hurt excepting the Company—who
suffered a loss of 4000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> by the collision. Independent,
therefore, of the heavy damages readily awarded by juries to any
one hurt by a railway accident, the injuries self-inflicted by the
Company on their own costly engines, carriages, &amp;c., are most
serious in amount, to say nothing of the almost incalculable
embarrassment they may create: indeed, taking into fair consideration
the costly results which have occurred to our railway
companies by the dislocation of a bolt, the unscrewing of a little
nut, or from a variety of other causes equally trifling, it may,
we believe, be truly said that the punishments which railway
companies have received from accidents have, generally speaking,
exceeded rather than fallen short of their offences; and thus
every intelligent board of directors is aware that safety in travelling
is more emphatically for the interest of railway proprietors
than any other consideration whatever: in short, that there is
nothing more expensive to a railway Company than an accident.</p>

<p>It being evident, therefore, that it is as much for the interests
of railway proprietors as of railway travellers that every possible
precaution should be taken by the Company to prevent accidents,
we have now to observe that to attain all the necessary
securities there is but one thing needful—namely, <span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span>. With
it Her Majesty’s Government might conscientiously undertake
the serious responsibility of prescribing all that Science could
administer for the safety of the public. Without money, what
government or what individual who had any character to lose
could for a moment undertake that which his judgment would
clearly admonish him to be utterly impracticable? Now, if this
reasoning be correct, the managers of our arterial railways were
certainly justified in expecting that, if the Government required
them to take every possible precaution to ensure <em>safe</em> travelling,
they would, as a matter of course, assist them in obtaining the
same means which they themselves would require had they to effect
the same object—namely, <span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span>. But instead of endeavouring
to obtain for railway companies these means—or rather, instead
of enabling them to retain the means which, under their respective
Acts of Parliament, they already legally possessed of
purchasing security for the public, Parliament, in compliance
with a popular outcry for <em>cheap</em> travelling, deemed it advisable to
require from railways a reduction of the tolls necessary to ensure
<span class="allsmcap">SAFE</span> travelling.</p>

<p>To any one who will carefully observe the practical working
of a railway, it is not only alarming, but appalling, to reflect on
the accidents which sooner or later <em>must</em> befall the public if the
master-mind which directs the whole concern, but which cannot
possibly illuminate the darkness of every one of its details, were
suddenly to be deprived of the talisman by which alone he can
govern a lineal territory four or five hundred miles in length—namely,
an abundant supply of <span class="allsmcap">MONEY</span>. Parliament may thunder—Government
may threaten—juries may punish—the public
may rave; but if the fustian-clad workmen who put together the
5416 pieces of which a locomotive engine is composed are insufficiently
paid—if the wages of the pointsmen, enginemen, and
police be reduced to that of common labourers—if cheap materials
are connected together by scamped workmanship—the black eyes,
bloody noses, fractured limbs, mangled corpses of the public,
will emphatically proclaim, as clearly as the hopper of a mill,
the emptiness of the exchequer. So long as the manager of a
railway has ample funds he ought to be prepared, regardless of
expense, to repair with the utmost possible despatch the falling-in
of a tunnel or any other serious accident to the works—in
short, the whole powers of his mind should be directed to the
paramount interests of the public, which, in fact, are identical
with those of the Company. But if he has no funds—or, what
is infinitely more alarming, in case, from want of funds, the impoverished
proprietors of the railway shall have angrily elected
in his stead the representative of an ignorant, ruinous, and narrow-minded
policy—how loudly would the public complain—how
severely would our commercial interests suffer, if, on the occurrence
to the works of any of the serious accidents to which we
have alluded, the new Ruler were to be afraid even to commence
any repairs until he should have been duly authorised by his newly-elected
economical colleagues to haggle and extract from a number
of contractors the cheapest tender!</p>

<p>But we fear it would not be difficult to show that, in reducing
the established rates of our great railways before their works
were completed, Parliament has unintentionally legislated upon
erroneous principles. For instance, we have already explained
that the profit of a railway depends upon the amount of the
population and goods which flow upon it from the towns it taps.
If, therefore, the traffic on an arterial line be but moderately remunerative,
it must be evident that a branch line must be an
unprofitable concern—unless, indeed, the company be authorized
to levy upon it <em>higher</em> tolls than are sufficient on the trunk line.
When, therefore, in the rapid development of our great national
railway system it was found necessary for the accommodation of
a fraction of the public to apply to Parliament for powers to
make these unremunerating branch lines, the companies were
certainly in theory entitled to expect the extra assistance we
have explained;—instead of which they were practically informed
that, unless they would consent to <span class="allsmcap">LOWER</span> their tolls
altogether, they would not be allowed to develop their system
by the construction of any branch line; which is as if a tenant
were to say to his landlord—“If you incur the expense of making
convenient bye-roads to my farm to enable me with facility to
take my crops to market, <em>you must lower my rent</em>.”</p>

<p>As it is undeniable that exorbitant rates, besides being inconvenient
to the public, are highly injurious to the real interests of
railway proprietors—indeed we have shown how enormously the
traffic of the country has been increased by low charges—we
would be fully disposed, not only most strongly to recommend,
but, as far as it may be legal, to enforce, that salutary principle;
but the insuperable difficulty of <em>at present</em> adjusting the proper
tolls to be levied on the public is, that no arterial railway in
Great Britain can either declare in figures, or even verbally explain,
the real state of its ultimate expenditure and receipts, for
the sole reason, namely, that the enterprise is not yet worked out,
and that no man breathing can foretell what are to be its limits.</p>

<p>What has become, we ask, of the <em>old</em> London and Birmingham
Railway (born only in 1836)—of the Grand Junction Railway—of
the Manchester and Birmingham—the Liverpool and Manchester
Railways—and of a score of others we could name?
What has become of the civil, or rather uncivil, war which all
these companies waged against each other; as well as against
Messrs. Pickford, the most powerful carriers in the world?
They have all lost the independence they respectively occupied,
and, like the ingredients cast by Macbeth’s witches “i’ th’
charmed pot,” they have “boiled,” or, as it is now-a-days termed,
amalgamated, into one great stock; and while this long continuous
arterial line has been drawing from the public for goods
and passenger traffic considerable receipts, it has been, and at
various localities still is, draining its own life-blood by the forced
construction of a number of sucking branch-lines, which, as far
as we can see, are not likely ever to be remunerative.</p>

<p>For some time railway companies deemed it their interest to
compete against each other, but this ruinous system was gradually
abandoned and is now reversed. The two lines from London
to Peterborough, after competing for several months, now divide
their profits. The two lines to Edinburgh will probably ere long
do the same. But besides this transmutation of competition into
combination, public notice was lately given that three of the
large arterial lines, namely, the Great Western, the South-Western,
and the London and North-Western, were meditating
an amalgamation of their respective stocks into one vast concern.
On this important project, which for the present has been abandoned,
we will offer a very few observations.</p>

<p>We believe it may be affirmed, without fear of contradiction,
that the working details of a railway are invariably well executed
in proportion to their magnitude:—that, for instance, in the
management of the London and North-Western Railway the
arrival and departure of trains are better regulated at their large
stations than at their small;—that their great manufactories are
better and more economically conducted than their little ones;—that
the arrangements of Messrs. Pickford and of Messrs. Chaplin
and Horne are better at Camden Town than at the small outlying
stations;—in short, we most distinctly observed that wherever
there was an enormous amount of important business to be
transacted, <em>there</em> were invariably to be found assembled superior
talents, superior workmen, superior materials; and that, on the
other hand, at small and secluded localities, where little work
was performed, inferior men, inferior waggons, horses, &amp;c., were
employed.</p>

<p>In the old system of travelling it was safer to drive along a
lonely road than through crowded streets; old horses as well as
old drivers were deemed safer than young ones; in fact, the more
the traveller was impeded, the less dangerous was his journey.
But on our railways, when once a man has tied himself to the
tail of a locomotive engine, it matters but little, especially in a
fog, whether he flies at the pace of fifty miles an hour, or whether
he crawls, as it is now termed, at the rate only of twenty; for,
in either case, if there be anything faulty in the works, machinery,
or management, accidents may occur to him which it is fearful
to contemplate.</p>

<p>Considering, therefore, that not only the ability necessary for
the general management of a railway, but the intelligence and
vigilance requisite at every station and on every portion of the
line are found practically to increase according to the demand,
and <i lang="la">vice versâ</i>, it is evident that nothing would prove more fatal
to the public as well as ruinous to proprietors than to split an
efficient remunerating great railway into two or more inefficient
and unremunerating small ones. A little railway, like “a little
war,” is murderous to those engaged in it,—ruinous to those who
pay for it; and we are therefore of opinion that it is for the
interest of the public not only that traffic should be concentrated
as much as possible on large lines, rich enough to purchase
management, engineering, servants, and materials of the very best
description, but that these great lines by uniting together should
voluntarily force themselves to exchange all paltry considerations,
mean exactions, and petty projects for those great principles
which alone should guide the administration of a <em>national
system</em> of railways. There can be no doubt that any description
of monopoly is abstractedly an evil, but if it be equally true that
every inch of railway throughout the country represents an integral
portion of a vast legally constituted monopolizing system,
the practical question to consider is, not whether monopoly is an
evil, but whether, of two evils, it would be more or less convenient
for Parliament and the public to deal with <em>one</em> monopoly
than with <em>many</em>;—whether, for instance, it would be more or
less easy for Government, in recommending alterations of fares,
&amp;c., to correspond solely with the directors of the London and
North-Western Railway than to communicate <i lang="la">seriatim</i> with the
boards of the several companies to whom the present line originally
belonged, each of which might possibly, in opposition to
each other, be pursuing a different course of policy.</p>

<p>As the new system has created an enormous increase of traffic,
so it has also, <em>pari passu</em>, developed talent proportionate to the
extraordinary demand for it; and, therefore, whatever may be
the imaginary dangers from a concentrated administration of our
railways, we feel confident that the public have much greater
reason to apprehend the inconveniences, to say the least, that
must inevitably result to them from those sudden unreasonable
changes of management, or rather of <em>mis</em>management, which are
sure periodically to take place so long as every separate railway
monopoly arbitrarily pursues not only its own system, but that
which its restless shareholders from time to time may think
proper to ordain. At all events, until the best plan of managing
our great railways shall have been finally ascertained, and most
especially until the unknown liabilities, expenses, and receipts
attendant upon the establishment over the surface of our country
of a series of iron highways shall have been accurately developed,
it must be utterly impossible for any practical man to decide to
what extent, if any, the Parliamentary tolls originally levied on
the public ought in equity to have been reduced.</p>

<p>The great truth, however, sooner or later must appear; and as
the hurricane, however violently it may blow, in due time is invariably
succeeded by a breathless calm;—as the ocean waves,
although mountain high, shortly subside;—as the darkest night
in a few hours turns into bright daylight;—so must the present
mystified prospects of our great railways inevitably ere long become
clear and transparent as those of any other mercantile firm;
and when this moment shall have arrived, we believe a very short
time will elapse before Parliament, the amalgamated Railway
Boards, and the public, will come to a creditable and amicable
adjustment; for while, on the other hand, it can never be the interest
of the public to prefer <em>cheap</em> to <span class="allsmcap">SAFE</span> travelling, so it can
never be the serious and fixed purpose of any body of men competent
to direct the affairs of our arterial railways to exact from
the public an exorbitant dividend which must inevitably create
condign punishment; for so sure as water finds its own level will
British capital always be forthcoming to lower by legitimate competition
anything like a continued usurious exaction from the
public. But a moment’s consideration of the following facts will
show that, as regards railway tolls, the public have as yet no very
great reason to complain.</p>

<p>1st. As regards the <span class="lock">public:—</span></p>

<p>In 1835 the fares paid by the public for travelling from London
to Liverpool, at the average rate of say 10 miles an hour,
were, exclusive of fees to guards and <span class="lock">coachmen—</span></p>

it appears that the capital expended on railways now open for
traffic, amounting to 148,400,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr>, gives a profit of 1·81 per

last forty years have averaged 9<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> 10<abbr title="shillings"><i>s.</i></abbr> 9<abbr title="pence"><i>d.</i></abbr> per cent. per annum.</p>

<p>Great as have been and still are the advantages to the country
of our inland navigation, it cannot be denied that the creation of
railways was a more hazardous undertaking than the construction
of canals. Without, however, offering any opinion as to the relative
profits which it has been the fortune of the proprietors of
each of these valuable undertakings to divide, we merely repeat
that, considering the unknown difficulties which for some time
must continue to obscure the future prospects of our railways, it
is neither for their interest nor that of the public that the managers
of these great national works should in the mean while be
cramped by want of means in the development of the important
system which it has pleased the Imperial Parliament to commit
to their hands instead of to the paternal management of Her
Majesty’s Government.</p>

<p>If the present alarming depreciation of railway property continue,
it is evident that decisive measures, good, bad, or indifferent,
will be deemed necessary by the shareholders to prevent, if possible,
further loss; and while, on the one hand, the public ought
not to be alarmed at impracticable threats, it is only prudent to
consider what will probably be the lamentable results of a civil
or rather of an uncivilized warfare between the travelling public
and the proprietors of the rails on which they travel.</p>

<p>In case the present reduced fares should prove to be unremunerative,
we have endeavoured to show that, unless the shareholders
in anger elect incompetent managers, the public have no reason
to entertain any extra apprehension from accidents;—for the
engine-driver might as well desire to run his locomotive over an
embankment as a company of proprietors—almost all of whom
are railway travellers—become reckless of their property as well
as of their lives. Indeed, if railway rates were to be further
reduced to-morrow, the public would, we believe, travel as safely,
and perhaps even more so, than at present. The result of inadequate
rates is not danger, but inconvenience, amounting to deprivation
of many of those advantages which the railway system
is calculated to bestow upon the country. For instance, to every
practical engineer it is well known that pace is just as expensive
on rails as on the road. At present the public travel fast, and
those who want to go long distances are accommodated with
trains that seldom stop. If, however, it does not suit them to
pay for speed, they cannot reasonably expect to have it. If
railway companies, as well as the public, are forced to economise,
both we believe would eventually be heavy losers by the transaction.
The London and North-Western Company, by taking off their express
trains, might at once save upwards of 20,000<abbr title="pounds"><i>l.</i></abbr> a-year, besides
severe extra damage to their rails. The railways in general might
reduce the number of their trains,—make them stop at every little
station,—run very slow,—suppress the delivery of day-tickets,—curtail
the expenses of their station accommodation,—and finally
abandon a number of tributary lines upon which large sums of
money have been expended. It must be for the public to determine
whether, for the sake of a small saving in their fares,
which after all are moderate as compared with other travelling
charges, they desire not only to forego the accommodation and
convenience to which they have lately become accustomed, but
to arrest the development of the railway system to its utmost extent,
and with its development its profits.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>But, whether our railways be eventually governed by high-minded
or by narrow-minded principles,—by one well-constituted
amalgamated board, or by a series of small disjointed local
authorities,—we trust our readers of all politics will cordially
join with us in a desire not unappropriate to the commencement
of a new year, that the wonderful discovery which it has
pleased the Almighty to impart to us, instead of becoming
among us a subject of angry dispute, may in every region of the
globe bring the human family into friendly communion; that it
may dispel national prejudices, assuage animosities; in short, that,
by creating a feeling of universal gratitude to the Power from
which it has proceeded, it may produce on earth peace and good
will towards men.</p>

<p class="unindent"><span class="smcap">Although</span> in describing the character of a dull man it is
customary to say of him “<cite>that he scarcely knows his right hand
from his left</cite>” yet, when it is considered that railway travellers
are undoubtedly the cleverest portion of every community—indeed
it is only very dull men or very dead ones that now-a-days
travel in stage-coaches or in hearses—it is difficult to explain
why millions of such travellers, highly intelligent on all other
subjects, should have continued for so long a time, and should
still continue, ignorant of important signals which are passing
not only close on each side of, but immediately before, behind,
and beneath them.</p>

<p>As the long dusty caravan full of human beings flying along
its iron orbit skims across the surface of “merry England,” its
guard is continually receiving police signals—stationary signals—semaphore
signals—junction signals—auxiliary signals—train
signals—special signals—and detonating signals.</p>

<p>Every human being in the train may also see or hear them,
and yet—whether for weal or woe—they are an alphabet which
none of us can read—symbols which none of us can interpret—short-hand
writing which none of us can decipher!</p>

<p>As an appropriate appendix, therefore, to our attempt to delineate
the practical working of a railway, we offer to such of
our readers as may be anxious “to read as they run” an
Official explanation, not only of every signal exhibited on the
London and North-Western Railway, but of the various orders
given to the servants of the Company, for the purpose of protecting
passengers of all classes from accident, injury, imposition,
or insult.</p>

<p>It surely appears advisable for all parties that orders of this
description should be made known to the public.</p>

<p>We annex them, therefore, without other comment than the
mere statement of the fact that By Authority of the Board of
Directors they have been very carefully collected—selected from
the Orders of almost all the other Railway Companies—and
compiled by the Company’s “General Manager,” Captain Huish.</p>

<b>Lamps</b> at Night.</p>

<p>In addition to this, any Signal, or the arm, <b>waved</b> violently,
denotes danger, and the necessity of stopping immediately.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><a id="Section_2a"></a>POLICE SIGNALS.</p>

<p>1. When the Line is clear, and nothing to
impede the progress of the Train, the Policeman

waved to and fro, the Policeman facing the Engine.</p>

<p>5. Engine-Drivers must invariably <b>stop</b> on seeing the Red
Signal.</p>

<p>6. As soon as the Engine passes, the Policeman will bring his
flag to the shoulder.</p>

<p>7. Every Policeman will be responsible for having his <b>Hand
Lamp</b> in good order and properly trimmed.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><a id="Section_2b"></a>STATIONARY SIGNALS.</p>

<p>8. On a stopping Train, or one travelling slowly, passing an
intermediate Station, the Red Signal will be shown for <b>Five
minutes</b>, to stop the Engine of any following Train, when the
Green Signal will be turned on for <b>Five minutes</b> more, to
complete the ten minutes precautionary Signal: on the Liverpool
and Manchester Line, the Red Signal will be turned on
<b>Three</b> minutes only and the Green <b>Five</b>.</p>

<p>9. On an Express Train or single Engine passing, the Green
Signal only need be shown for <b>Five minutes</b>.</p>

<p>10. The Red Signal will be shown while a Train is stopping
at a Station, and for <b>Five minutes</b> after its departure, when
the Green Signal will be turned on for <b>Five minutes</b> more.</p>

<p>11. On a Train entering a long Tunnel the <b>Red</b> Signal will
be turned on for <b>Ten minutes</b>, or until the Policeman shall
have received Telegraphic notice that the Train has emerged
from the other end, when the <b>Green</b> Signal will be turned on

<p>8. The <b>Caution</b> Signal by the <b>green</b> Light.</p>

<p>9. The <b>Danger</b> Signal by the <b>red</b> Light.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><a id="Section_2e"></a>JUNCTION SIGNALS.</p>

<p>10. Every Junction is provided with Two Semaphore Signal
Posts, corresponding with the two meeting Railways; and the
<em>Signals</em> for each Line are shown on the <em>Signal</em> Post appropriated
to it.</p>

<p>11. The Signals for Caution and Danger, by Day and Night,
are shown in the same way as on the Station Signal Posts.</p>

<p>12. The Semaphore Arms and the Lamps for DAY and
NIGHT Signals at the Junctions are always set at <b><span class="allsmcap">DANGER</span></b>,
and no Engineman is allowed to pass without the Arm is lowered
to <b><span class="allsmcap">CAUTION</span></b>, or the <b>Green</b> Light is shown by the Lamp.</p>

<p>N.B. At the Junctions there are no <b><span class="allsmcap">ALL RIGHT</span></b> Signals,
as it is necessary in passing them to go cautiously and slow.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><a id="Section_2f"></a>AUXILIARY SIGNALS.</p>

<p>13. At many of the principal Stations, Auxiliary Signals,
worked by a wire, are placed 500 yards in advance of the
Station Signal Post. These Auxiliary Signals are intended to
warn the Enginemen and Guards in thick weather (when the
main Signal cannot be well seen at the usual distance) of the
<b>Red</b> being turned on at the Station, and for this purpose a <b>Green</b>
Signal is shown at the Auxiliary Post. Except when the Red
Signal is shown at the Station, no Signal whatever is shown by
the Auxiliary. The Enginemen are not to depend solely upon
the Auxiliary Signals; but they may always depend on the
<b>Red</b> Signal being on at the Station whenever the <b>Green</b> is seen
at the Auxiliary.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><a id="Section_2g"></a>TRAIN SIGNALS.</p>

<p>14. Every Engine with a Passenger Train shall carry a
<b>White</b> Light on the Buffer Plank by Night, and every Cattle,
Merchandize, or Coal Train, a <b>Green</b> Light.</p>

<p>15. In order to distinguish the Trains while running on the
Liverpool and Manchester Branch, the Grand Junction Passenger
Trains will carry <b>two</b> White Lights, and the Merchandize
Trains <b>two</b> Green Lights, between Liverpool and Warrington,
and the North Union Passenger Trains will carry a <b>Blue</b> instead
of a White Light on the Buffer Plank of Passenger Trains,
and a <b>Blue</b> in addition to the Green Light on the Merchandize
and Coal Trains.</p>

<p>16. Every Train, after sunset or in foggy weather, shall
carry one or more <b>Red Tail Lights</b>, according to the description
of the Train.</p>

<p>17. The Guard of the Train is responsible for attaching the
Tail Lamps on the last carriage or waggon, and the Engine-Driver
and Fireman for placing the Lamp on the Engine.
When a carriage is detached at a Junction, care must be taken
to see that the Tail Light is removed, and re-attached to the
Train.</p>

<p>18. The Tail Signal must be inspected at <b>every Station</b>;
and in the event of the Train being brought to a stand on the
Main Line from any cause, the Guard must take care that no
one stand before the Tail Lamp, so as to prevent its being seen.</p>

<p>19. A <b>Red Board</b> or Flag by Day, or an <b>extra</b> Tail Lamp
by Night, hung at the back of an Engine or Train, denotes that
an <b>extra Train</b> is to follow.</p>


<p class="p2 center ls"><a id="Section_2h"></a>SPECIAL SIGNALS.</p>

<p class="center">NEWTON JUNCTION.</p>

<p>20. By Night a <b>Green</b> Light, visible from either of the
Liverpool and Manchester Main Lines, denotes that the points
are open for Trains going towards Warrington.</p>

<p>21. When a Grand Junction Train from Liverpool is approaching
the Junction Points at Newton Junction, at the same
time that a Train from Manchester for Liverpool is also approaching,
Signals must be given to <b>both Trains to stop</b>; and
if there is any doubt that there will be danger of collision
in the Grand Junction Train crossing the Liverpool South Line,
the Pointman must <b>not</b> turn the points for the Line to Warrington,
but must let the Grand Junction Train run past the
points towards Manchester.</p>

<p>22. Whenever the line at Newton Junction is obstructed, or
an Engine or Waggon is being shunted, the attention of the
Pointmen on the Liverpool and Manchester Line must be called
to the circumstance by <b>ringing the Bells</b> at the top of the Incline.
<b>Two Bells</b> are fixed for the Pointmen at the Junction,
whereby Signals may be exchanged between them and the Grand
Junction Pointman.</p>

<p>23. Whenever a Train is ascending the Warrington Incline,
whether for Liverpool or Manchester, at the same time that a
Train from either of those Stations for Warrington is approaching
Newton Junction, the Pointman will stop the <b>latter</b> until the
former Train has passed the curve; he will also take care that
an interval of not less than <b>five minutes</b> is allowed between the
passing of any two Trains towards Warrington.</p>

<p>24. If, when any Liverpool and Manchester Second Class
Train has arrived at the Warrington Junction, a Birmingham
Train is seen coming up the Warrington Inclined Plane, the
Engineman must stop, and allow the Birmingham Train to <b>pass
before him</b> to Liverpool.</p>

<p>25. If the Birmingham Coach Train overtake a Liverpool and
Manchester Second Class Train more than 3 miles distance from
Liverpool, the Second Class Train <b>must shunt</b>, if there be an
opportunity, to allow the Birmingham to pass.</p>

<p>N.B.—The same rule applies equally to Third Class Trains.</p>

<p class="p2 center sansserif">DIRECTIONS FOR THE USE OF DETONATING
SIGNALS IN FOGGY WEATHER.</p>
<br>
<p>1. These Signals are to be placed on the Rail (label upwards),
by bending the lead clip round the upper flange of the Rail, to
prevent its falling off. When the Engine passes over the Signal,
it explodes with a loud report, and the Driver is instantly to
stop.</p>

<p>2. The use of Fog Signals is to be in addition to the regular
Day and Night Signals of the Line, which must be first exhibited.</p>

<p>3. Whenever an accident occurs to a Train, by which the
Line is obstructed, the Guard is to go back 600 yards, to stop
any Engine or Train following on the same Line, and as he proceeds
he is to place on the Rail, at the distance of every 200 yards,
one of these Signals; and on his arriving at the end of the above-mentioned
distance, he is to place Two Signals upon the Line of
Rail.</p>

<p>4. Should the accident occasion the stoppage of both Lines of
Rail, the Guard is to send the under Guard or Fireman in
advance of the Train, to place the Signals on the opposite Line
of Rail to that which the Train is on, in the same order as to
distance as is above directed for the Guard, by which precaution
both Lines of Rail will be protected.</p>

<p>5. In case of the stoppage of either Line of Rail from any
cause, or there being any danger apprehended in the passage of
an Engine or Train, whether in Foggy Weather or otherwise,
the Station Police, Signal, Switch, or Tunnel man, is to place one
of these Signals on the Line or Lines of Rail so obstructed, every
200 yards from the point of danger, until the Line or Lines of
Rail are so protected for half a mile.</p>

<p>6. In Foggy Weather these Signals are to be similarly used
whenever an Engine or Train is following, or likely to follow,
too closely upon another Engine or Train, or in cases of emergency
or great danger.</p>

<p>7. Whenever an Engine passes over one of these Signals, the
Engine-Driver is immediately to stop the Train, and the Guards
are to protect their Train by sending back and placing a Signal
on the Line every 200 yards, to the distance of 600 yards; the
Train may then proceed slowly to the place of obstruction.</p>

<p>8. After the obstruction of the Line is removed, the Guards,
Police, or Engine-Driver, must remove all the Signals from the
Rails before proceeding.</p>

<p>9. Each Guard, Policeman, and Pointsman, not at a Station,
and all Enginemen, Gatemen, Foremen of Works, Gangers of
Plate-Layers, and Tunnelmen, will be provided with packets of
Signals, which they are always to have ready for use whilst on
duty; and every Officer in charge of a Station will be provided
with these Signals, which are to be kept in an unlocked drawer
or shelf in the counter, in order that they may at all times be
easy of access to all on duty at the Station: and every person
connected with the Station shall be made acquainted with the
place where they are deposited.</p>

<p>10. All the persons above named will be held responsible for
their having the proper supply of Fog Signals; when one or
more are expended, it is their duty immediately to apply to the
Superintendent of their section for a further supply to keep up
the stock as above directed.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2 center sansserif">REGULATIONS FOR ENGINEMEN.</p>
<br>
<p>1. No Engine shall pass along the wrong line of Road, but if,
in case of accident, an Engine shall be unavoidably obliged to
pass back on the wrong line, the Engineman is to send his Assistant,
or some other competent person, back a distance of not
less than <b>800</b> yards, before his Engine moves, to warn any Engine
coming in the opposite direction, and the Assistant shall continue
running, so as to preserve the distance of not less than <b>800</b>
yards between him and the Engine. If dark, the man shall take
his light and make a signal by waving the same <b><span class="allsmcap">UP</span></b> and <b><span class="allsmcap">DOWN</span></b>,
and the Engineman of the Engine moving on the wrong line
shall keep his Steam Whistle constantly going, and must not
move in the wrong direction farther than to the nearest shunt,
where he is instantly to remove his Engine off the wrong line of
Road; and it is expressly forbidden that any Engine should move
on the wrong line of Rails at a greater speed than <b>four miles an
hour</b>.</p>

<p>2. All Engines travelling on the same line shall keep <b>800</b>
yards at least apart from each other, that is to say,—the Engine
which follows shall not approach within <b>800</b> yards of the Engine
which goes before, unless expressly required.</p>

<p>3. No person, except the proper Engineman and Fireman shall
be allowed to ride on the Engine or Tender, without the <b>special</b>
permission of the Directors, or one of the Chief Officers of the
Company.</p>

<p>4. The Engineman and Fireman must appear on duty as clean
as circumstances will allow, and every Driver must be with his
Engine 30 minutes, and every Fireman 45 minutes, before the time
appointed for starting, in order to see that the Engine is in proper
order to go out, has the necessary supply of coke and water,
and that the Signals are in a fit state for use.</p>

<p>5. The Front Buffer Light of a Passenger Train is <b>White</b>, and
of a Goods or Cattle Train <b>Green</b>, except on the Liverpool and
Manchester Section.</p>

<p>6. Every Engineman shall have with him at all times in his
Tender the following <span class="lock">Tools:—</span></p>


<ul><li>1 complete set of Lamps</li>
<li>1 complete set of Screw Keys</li>
<li>1 large and small Monkey Wrench</li>
<li>3 Cold Chisels</li>
<li>1 Hammer</li>
<li>1 Crow Bar</li>
<li>2 short Chains with Hooks</li>
<li>1 Screw Jack</li>
<li>A quantity of Flax and Twine</li>
<li>4 large and small Oil Cans</li>
<li>Plugs for Tubes</li>
<li>2 Fire Buckets</li>
<li>Fog Signals and Red Flag</li>
</ul>

<p>7. When the Engine is in motion, the Engineman is to stand
where he can keep a good look-out a-head, and the Fireman must
at all times be ready to obey the instructions of the Engineman,
and assist him in keeping a look-out, when not otherwise engaged.</p>

<p>8. No Engine is permitted to stand on the <b>main line</b> (except
under very special circumstances) when not attached to a Train,
and the Engineman shall not at any time leave his Engine or
Train, or any part thereof, on the main line, unless there be a
competent man in charge to make the necessary signals.</p>

<p>9. No Engine shall cross the Line of Railway at a Station
without permission.</p>

<p>10. An Engineman is never to leave an Engine in Steam,
without shutting the Regulator, putting the Engine out of gear,
and fixing down the Tender Break.</p>

<p>11. No Engine is allowed to <b>propel</b> a Train of Carriages or
Waggons, but must in all cases draw it, except when assisting up
inclined planes, or when required to start a train from a Station,
or in case of an Engine being disabled on the road, when the
succeeding Engine may propel the train <b>slowly</b> (approaching it
with great caution) as far as the next shunt or turn-out, at which
place the propelling Engine shall take the lead.</p>

<p>12. No Engine is to run on the Main Line <b>Tender foremost</b>,
unless by orders from the Locomotive Superintendent, or from
unavoidable necessity.</p>

<p>13. Every Engineman on going out is to take his <b>Time Table</b>
with him, and regulate by it the speed of his Engine, whether
attached to a Train or not; and when not attached to a Train,
he is on no account to stop at second-class Stations unless specially
ordered, or there is a signal for him to do so.</p>

<p>14. Enginemen are not allowed (except in case of accident or
sudden illness) to change their Engines on the Journey, nor to
leave their respective Stations, without the permission of their
Superintendent.</p>

<p>15. When the Road is obscured by steam or smoke (owing to
a burst tube, or any other cause), no approaching Engine is
allowed to <b>pass through the steam</b>, until the Engineman shall
have ascertained that the road is clear; and if any Engineman
perceive a Train stopping, from accident or other cause, on the
road, he is immediately to <b>slacken his speed</b>, so that he may pass
such Train slowly, and stop altogether if necessary, in order to
ascertain the cause of the stoppage, and report it at the next
Station.</p>

<p>16. Where there is an accident on the opposite Line to that
on which he is moving, he is to stop all the Trains between the
spot and the next Station, and <b>caution</b> the respective Enginemen,
and further he is to render every assistance in his power in all
cases of difficulty.</p>

<p>17. In case of accident to his Engine or Tender (when alone)
he is to send back notice by his Fireman to the nearest Policeman
on duty: but if the Policeman is too distant, the Fireman is
to remain stationary not less than <b>600</b> yards in rear of his Train
(until recalled), showing his Red Signal until he has rejoined his
Engine. (See <a href="#Rule_17">Rule 17</a>, page 182.)</p>

<p>18. Enginemen are strictly prohibited from throwing out of
their Tender any small <b>coke</b> or dust, except into the pits made
for that purpose at first-class Stations.</p>

<p>19. Enginemen with Pilot or Assistant Engines must be prepared
(while on duty) to start immediately on receiving instructions
from the Locomotive Foreman or the Station Master.</p>

<p>20. Enginemen are strictly enjoined to <b>start and stop their
Trains slowly</b>, and without a jerk, which is liable to snap the
couplings and chains; and they are further warned to be careful
not to shut off their steam too suddenly (except in case of danger),
so as to cause a concussion of the carriages.—This rule applies
more especially to <b>Cattle Trains</b>, the beasts being liable to be
thrown down and injured by a sudden check.</p>

<p>21. No Engineman is to start his Train until the proper
Signal is given: he is invariably to start with care, and to
observe that he has the whole of his Train before he gets beyond
the limits of the Station.</p>

<p>22. It is very important that Engine-Drivers use the utmost
caution when shunting Waggons into sidings, so as to avoid
injuring the Waggons or other property of the Company.</p>

<p>23. Enginemen in bringing up their Trains are to pay particular
attention to the state of the <b>weather</b> and the condition of the
<b>Rails</b>, as well as to the length of the Train: and these circumstances
must have due weight in determining when to shut off
the Steam. Stations must not be entered so rapidly as to require
a violent application of the Breaks, and any Engineman overrunning
the Station will be reported.</p>

<p>24. Enginemen and others are required to be careful in turning
their Engines on the Tables, so as not to <b>swing</b> them round
rapidly.</p>

<p>25. Engines running alone, or taking luggage or empty carriages,
must not exceed a speed of <b>20</b> miles an hour without
distinct orders in each case, or some urgent necessity.</p>

<p>26. Enginemen and Firemen are to pay immediate attention
to all <b>Signals</b>, whether the cause of the Signal is known to them
or not; and any Engineman neglecting to obey a Signal is liable
to immediate dismissal from the Company’s service. The Engineman
must not, however, <b>trust to Signals</b>, but on all occasions be
vigilant and cautious, and on no account be running before the
time specified in his Time-Table. He is also to obey the Special
orders of the Officers in charge of Stations, when required for
the Company’s service.</p>

<p>27. Whenever he sees the <b>Red Signal</b>, or any other which he
understands to be a Signal to stop, he is to bring his Engine to a
stand close to the Signal, and on no account to pass it.</p>

<p>28. In addition to the usual Red Signals, the Police have
orders to place <b>Detonators</b> on the Rails in foggy weather, and
every Engineman, when he hears a Detonating Signal, is to
bring his Engine to a stand as quickly as possible. The Enginemen
also are supplied with these Signals to be used in the same
manner. (See <a href="#Section_3"><cite>Rule for Fog Signals</cite></a>.)</p>

<p>29. <b>Ballast</b> Engines are prohibited from passing along the
Main Line in a <b>fog</b>, except when authorised to do so under special
circumstances.</p>

<p>30. As a further precaution in foggy weather, no Engineman
is allowed to leave a Station with a Train until the preceding
Train has been started at least <b>ten minutes</b>; and before starting,
the Clerk in charge of the Station, or the Policeman on duty, is
to give the Engineman <b>the exact time</b> when the preceding Train
started, and where it is next to stop.</p>

<p>31. Enginemen are at all times to use great caution in <b>foggy
weather</b>, and especially in approaching Stations, from the difficulty
of discerning the regular Signals until close upon them;
and they are to be prepared to bring their Engines to a stand,
should it be required.</p>

<p>32. No Engineman is to pass from a Branch on to the Main
Line until the Policeman at the Junction Points signals the
Main Line clear, and in foggy weather he is to bring his Engine
to a stand before reaching the <b>Junction Points</b>, and not to enter
upon the Main Line till he has ascertained from the Policeman
how long the preceding Train or Engine has passed.</p>

<p>33. To avoid risk of collision on single Lines, from the meeting
of another Engine, no extra Engine, with or without a Train,
is allowed to pass along the Line without <b>previous notice</b>.</p>

<p>34. Every Engineman is to be careful, when he passes a
Station, or when the way is under repair, to proceed slowly and
cautiously; and he is also to do so whenever he sees the <b>Green
Signal</b>.</p>

<p>35. Luggage, Coal, and Ballast Trains are always to give way
to Passenger Trains by going into the nearest siding.</p>

<p>36. The Whistle is to be sounded on approaching each Station
and level crossing, and on entering the Tunnels. <b>Three</b> short
sharp whistles, rapidly repeated, must be given when danger is
apprehended, and when it is necessary to call the attention of the
Guards to put on the Breaks. When more than one Engine is
attached to the Train, the Signal is to be given by the Leading
Engineman; and in case of danger is to be repeated by the
following Enginemen, who will forthwith reverse their Engines
and attach their Tender Breaks. Frequent use must be made of
the Whistle in foggy weather.</p>

<p>37. Enginemen with Luggage Trains are to approach all
stopping places at a speed not exceeding <b>ten miles</b> an hour, when
within a quarter of a mile of the stopping place, and to signal
the Breaksman by <b>two</b> distinct Whistles to put on his Break
before the Tender Break is put on.</p>

<p>38. Luggage Enginemen must refuse to take up waggons of
goods, if they are of a nature to take fire by a spark or hot cinder,
unless such goods are <b>completely sheeted</b>. Enginemen are to
see that the cinder-plates at the back of their Tenders are in
good order.</p>

<p>39. Should <b>fire</b> be discovered in the Train, the Steam must
be instantly shut off, and the Breaks applied, and the Train be
brought to a stand, the Signal of obstruction to the Line be
made, and the burning waggon or waggons be detached with as
little delay as possible. No attempt must ever be made to run
on to the nearest water column, if it is more than <b>300 yards</b>
from the place where the fire is discovered, as such a course is
likely to increase the damage.</p>

<p>40. The movements of all Trains are under the orders of the
Guard, to whose instructions as to stopping, starting, &amp;c., the
Engineman is to pay implicit attention.</p>

<p>41. If any part of a Train is detached when in motion, care
must be taken not to stop the Train in front before the detached
part has stopped, and it is the duty of the Guard of such detached
part to apply his Break in time to prevent a collision with the
carriages in front, in the event of their stopping.</p>

<p>42. Whenever a Red Board or Red Flag is carried on the
last carriage or waggon of a passing Train, it is to indicate that
a <b>Special</b> or <b>Extra Train</b> is to follow; and when such Extra
Train is to run at night, an additional Red Light must be attached
to the tail of the preceding Train.</p>

<p>43. Every Engineman at the end of his journey is to report to
the Superintendent of Locomotive Power, or his Foreman, or to
the Clerk in <span class="lock">attendance—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em>First</em>—As to the state of his Engine and Tender.</p>

<p><em>Second</em>—As to any defect in the Road or Works,
Electric Telegraph posts or wires, or any unusual circumstance
that may have taken place on the journey.</p>
</div>

<p>44. He is also to see that his Signal and Gauge Lamps are
taken into the Porter’s Lodge, for the purpose of being trimmed.</p>


<p class="p2 center larger">SPECIAL REGULATIONS.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><a id="Section_4a"></a>LONDON AND BIRMINGHAM SECTION.</p>

<p>45. Enginemen with Express Trains are to slacken speed
round the curves at Weedon, Leighton, and Berkhampstead.</p>

<p>46. Whenever an Engineman approaches <b>Camden</b> Station in
a fog, or whenever the Policeman at the South entrance of the
Primrose Tunnel shows the Green Signal, he is to bring his
Engine to a stand at <b>Chalk Farm Bridge</b>, unless on his arrival
there the Policeman signals him to proceed.</p>

<p>47. The same regulation is to be observed on his approaching
<b>Birmingham</b> in foggy weather; and when the Green Signal is
shown by the Policeman near the <b>new Canal Bridge</b>, he is to
stop at the Ticket Platform, unless there signalled to proceed.</p>

<p><a id="Rule_48"></a>48. Whenever the Pilot Engineman, assisting a Train from
Euston, intends to run into the siding at the summit of the
incline, he is to detach his Engine before arriving at the Ticket
Platform, and, on approaching the Policeman at the facing
points, motion to the left with his hand (by night with his hand-lamp):
in the absence of this signal the Policeman is not to alter
the points, but to allow the Engines and Train to pass on the
Main Line.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><a id="Section_4b"></a>GRAND JUNCTION SECTION.</p>

<p>49. All Trains passing from or to the Liverpool, Manchester,
and the Grand Junction Railways at Newton, are to slacken
speed so that the same shall not exceed <b>Five</b> miles an hour
before passing from one line to the other.</p>

<p>50. Engines passing from the Chester Line to the Main Line
at Crewe are to come to a stand before entering the Main Line.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><i>Inclined Planes.</i></p>

<p>51. The Assistant Engine is invariably to return down the
left-hand Line, and no Luggage Engine is to leave any part of
its Train on the Main Line unless in case of urgent necessity.
No Luggage Engine is to attempt to ascend the <b>Sutton</b> and
<b>Whiston</b> Inclines with a greater load than their Engines,
assisted by the Bank Engines, can manage: and if any doubt
exist whether the Engines are or are not able to take up the
whole load at one trip, the Train must be stopped at the bottom,
and the requisite number of Waggons be shunted, and left in a
<b>siding</b> and <b>not</b> on the Main Line.</p>

<p>52. In the event of any Waggons being left upon or at the
foot of the Incline, and a succeeding Engine coming up, such
Engine is not to commence propelling or drawing the said
Waggons until the Engines which left them shall have returned.</p>

<p>53. No Engine, either with Passengers, Coals, or Merchandize,
is to go down the Inclined Plane at a greater speed than 30 miles
an hour, and no Engineman is to attempt to make up lost time
in going down any Inclined Plane; and coming down <b>Whiston
Incline</b>, no Engineman shall begin to increase his speed till he
reaches <b>Huyton Quarry</b> Station.</p>

<p>54. In going down the Inclined Planes, Enginemen, Guards,
and Breaksmen must take care that they have complete control
over the speed of the Trains by applying their Breaks.</p>

<p>55. Enginemen with Trains requiring assistance up the
<b>Whiston</b> and <b>Sutton</b> Inclined Planes are required in all cases
to go up the bank first and let the Assistant Engine follow.</p>

<p>56. All Enginemen are required to give one loud whistle as
they pass <b>Platt’s Bridge</b>.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><a id="Section_4c"></a>MANCHESTER AND BIRMINGHAM SECTION.</p>

<p>57. An interval of not less than <b>Five Minutes</b> must elapse
between any two Trains travelling in either direction on the
same line of Rails between <b>Store Street Station</b> and the <b>Sheffield
Junction</b>; and on this part of the Line, all Engines, with or
without Trains, must proceed at such a reduced speed as will
enable the Engineman to stop almost instantaneously, if required
so to do.</p>

<p>58. Every Train from the Manchester and Sheffield Line must
stop before arriving at the <b>Junction</b>, and wait until the Policeman
in charge of the Junction Points indicates that the Line is
clear. Should the Manchester and Birmingham Down Train
have exceeded the proper time of passing the Sheffield Junction,
and the Manchester and Sheffield Train have arrived at its proper
time, or before the other is in sight, the Sheffield Train will
proceed <b>First</b> to the Station.</p>

<p>59. Enginemen on approaching the Sheffield Junction, from
whatever direction, with or without a Train, are invariably to
blow the Steam Whistle as soon as they arrive within a quarter
of a mile of the Junction, and they must not pass that place at a
greater speed than <b>Five</b> miles an hour.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><a id="Section_4d"></a>TRENT VALLEY SECTION.</p>

<p>60. Enginemen proceeding to the Trent Valley Line are to
open their Whistles once when they arrive within a quarter of a
mile of the Junctions at Stafford and Rugby, motion with their
hand, or hand-lamp, as a signal to the man at the Junction
Points, and must invariably slacken speed to <b>Five</b> miles an hour.
Engines to or from Birmingham are to give <b>two clear whistles</b>,
with an interval between them, on approaching the Junctions.
The slackening of speed is especially enjoined on the Enginemen
from Birmingham in case of a Train to or from the Trent
Valley being in the act of crossing.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><a id="Section_4e"></a>BOLTON BRANCH.</p>

<p>61. Enginemen having charge of Coal or Ballast Trains
travelling so as to meet a Passenger Train, are not to pass any
Siding or Station at a less interval than <b>fifteen minutes</b> before
the time at which the next Passenger Train is due, and every
Engineman must make himself well acquainted with the time of
the Passenger Trains.</p>

<p>62. Enginemen are required to slacken speed previous to
crossing the Turnpike Roads at Daubhill, Chequerbent, and
Crook Street.</p>

<p>63. All Enginemen are directed not to pass through the
Points at the Double Road on Dean Moor at a greater speed
than <b>eight</b> miles an hour, nor over the <b>curve</b> between Leigh
and Bradshaw Leach Stations at a greater speed than <b>twelve</b>
miles an hour.</p>

</div>

<p class="p2 center sansserif">REGULATIONS FOR GUARDS.</p>

<p>1. Each ordinary Train on the Main Line is to have at least
<b>two</b> guards, and the short Trains on the Branch Lines <b>one</b>
Guard. If the Train is very heavy, additional Guards will be
sent with it, at the discretion of the Superintendent.</p>

<p>2. Every Guard is to be at the Station from which he is to
start <b>half an hour</b> before the appointed time, that he may see to
the marshalling of the Carriages, and the arrangement of the
Passengers’ Luggage, Parcels, &amp;c.</p>

<p>He is to see that he has on the Train,</p>

<ul>
<li>&ensp;1 Pair of Signal Flags and Case.</li>
<li>&ensp;1 Hand Signal Lamp and Box.</li>
<li>&ensp;2 Canisters of Fog Signals and Blue Lights.</li>
<li>12 Links and Box.</li>
<li>&ensp;1 Pair of Levers.</li>
<li>&ensp;1 Box for Despatches.</li>
</ul>

<p>3. Until the Train starts the Guards will be under the order
of the Station Master.</p>

<p>4. Every Guard is to see that his <b>Signal lamps</b> are in a fit
state for use and properly trimmed; the Senior Guard will
ascertain that the Tail and Side Lights are securely fixed before
the Train starts, and is responsible for their being lighted at
sunset as well as during a Fog.</p>

<p>5. The Train, when in motion, will be under the order and
control of the Senior Guard; the Passengers and their Luggage
must be considered in his charge, and he will be responsible for
the safety and regularity of the whole. He is to keep the time
of running, and will be answerable that any Carriage which is to
be left at an intermediate Station is detached.</p>

<p>6. With through Trains (viâ the Trent Valley) in which the
whole journey is performed without change of Guard, there will
be <b>three</b> Guards between London and Rugby, and the following
will be the <span class="lock">arrangements:—</span></p>

<p>The Senior Guard will run between <b>London and Liverpool</b>,
and have charge of the whole service connected with that portion
of the Train including the Traffic to the North through
Parkside and that to Chester; delivering the former at Warrington
and the latter at Crewe, to the Branch Guards there.
The same on the return journey.</p>

<p>The Second Guard will run between <b>London and Manchester</b>,
and will have charge of the whole service connected therewith,
and also the road-side business in Parcels, Luggage, &amp;c., between
Rugby and Crewe. He will also keep the time between Crewe
and Manchester, and make out his Way Bill for that Line.</p>

<p>The Third Guard will run between <b>London and Birmingham</b>,
and have charge of the whole service connected therewith, and
also the road-side business in parcels, Luggage, &amp;c., between
London and Rugby. He will also keep the time between Rugby
and Birmingham, and make out his Way Bill for that portion of
the journey.</p>

<p>7. When there are <b>two Guards</b> with a Train, the under Guard
will ride in the Van next to the Tender. He will stand with his
back to it, and keep his attention fixed on the Train, looking
alternately <b>down</b> either side, and noting any irregularity in the
running—any particular oscillation of a Carriage, or any signal
which may be made by a Passenger.</p>

<p>He will be provided with the means of immediately communicating
with the Engineman in the event of any circumstance
arising which may render it prudent or necessary to stop the
Train.</p>

<p>The place of the Senior Guard will be on the last Passenger
Carriage, which must always be a <b>Van</b> or a <b>Break Carriage</b>, and
his duty will be to look <b>forward</b> and communicate with the
Second Guard on the leading Carriage.</p>

<p>With through Trains when there are <b>three</b> Guards with a
Train, their position will necessarily be regulated by the division
of the Line to which their section of the Train is proceeding,
but the duties of the Guard on the <b>leading</b> and <b>last</b> Carriage
will always be as stated above, the <b>middle</b> man communicating
between them.</p>

<p>8. On arrival of a Train at a Terminus the Guards are
not to leave the Platform until they have delivered over all
<b>Parcels</b> as well as <b>Luggage</b> to the Porters appointed to take
charge of them, and if any article is missing they are immediately
to report the same to the officer in charge of the Station.</p>

<p>9. Before leaving the Station the Guards are to make out a
return according to a printed form, noting at the foot every circumstance
of an <b>unusual</b> character that may have happened;
they are also to state on this return whether all the Parcels and
Luggage by the Train have been duly delivered.</p>

<p>10. The number of any Carriage complained of as <b>uneasy</b>,
and the Division to which it belongs, must be entered on the
Way Bill.</p>

<p>11. Should any Train <b>overshoot</b> the Water Pillar at a stopping
place by the length of the Train, the circumstance must be
noted on the Bill.</p>

<p>12. No Passenger is to be allowed to <b>ride outside</b>, without
special permission.</p>

<p>13. Guards must keep a good look-out that no Passenger on
arriving at any Station gets out for the purpose of <b>re-booking</b>
by the same Train, as this is forbidden by the Regulations.</p>

<p>14. Guards are forbidden to pass over the <b>tops of the Carriages</b>
when in motion, and any Guard doing this without urgent necessity
will be fined.</p>

<p>15. The Doors of the Carriages on the off side are always to
be <b>locked</b>, and Guards are charged to request Passengers to keep
their seats in case of any stoppages on the road, except when
necessary to alight.</p>

<p>16. <b>Smoking</b> in the Carriages and at Stations is forbidden by
the Regulations. The Guard must prevent Passengers endangering
themselves by imprudent exposure. In the event of any
Passenger being <b>drunk and disorderly</b>, to the annoyance of
others, the Guard is to use all gentle means to stop the nuisance;
failing which, he must, for the safety and convenience of all,
exercise his authority, and confine him in a separate place until
he arrives at the next Station.</p>

<p><a id="Rule_17"></a>17. When a Passenger or Luggage Train <b>comes to a stand
on the Main Line</b>, or is only enabled to proceed at a very slow
pace, the Senior Guard is to send back notice by the Junior
Guard to the nearest Policeman, if within distance for prompt
communication; but if too far, then the Junior Guard will
remain stationary, not less than <b>600</b> yards in rear of the Train,
showing his Red Signal until recalled. Should the 600 yards
terminate near a curve in the Line, he is to continue on until
his Red Signal can be well seen round the curve; and before
starting to rejoin his Train, he is to leave one of the 10-minute
Blue Light Signals by the side of the Rail. Should the Train
have only one Guard, he will perform this duty.</p>

<p>18. Every Guard is to observe the strictest attention and
obedience to all the <b>Signals</b> and <b>auxiliary Signals</b> at Crossings,
intermediate Stations, Tunnels, and of each Policeman on the
Line, as well as to respect all special orders which the officer in
charge of Stations may think necessary.</p>

<p>19. In the event of accident, blocking one Line and requiring
the Train to pass along the wrong Line, the utmost caution
must be exercised; and no Train is to be permitted to proceed
on the wrong Line without a <b>Memorandum in Writing</b> from a
person in authority at the spot where the accident has happened.
So liable are verbal messages to be misunderstood, that, should a
verbal message be received to send forward a Train on the wrong
Line, the messenger must be sent back for a written order before
the Train is allowed to move.</p>

<p>20. Whenever a regular Train is to be followed by a special
one, a <b>Red</b> Board or Flag is to be affixed on the rear of the last
carriage of the regular Train by Day, and an additional Tail
Light by Night. The Senior Guard of a Passenger Train, and
the Guard of a Luggage Train, must ascertain for what purpose
this Signal is affixed. He is to see that it is removed at the
proper Station, and will report the circumstance under which
the Special Train is about to follow.</p>

<p>21. When from accident to the Train, or from any other
cause, it is necessary to <b>secure the attention</b> of the Engineman,
the Guard is to apply his Break sharply, and as suddenly release
it. This operation repeated several times is almost certain, from
the check it occasions, to attract the notice of the Driver, to
whom the Red Flag or Lamp must be immediately waved as a
signal to stop.</p>

<p>22. The Guard must not allow any Passenger or parcel to be
conveyed by the Train unless <b>properly booked</b>; and if he has
reason to suppose that any Passenger is without a Ticket, or is
not in the proper Carriage, he must request the Passenger to
show the Ticket. When a Passenger is desirous of changing his
place from an <b>inferior</b> to a <b>superior</b> carriage, the Guard must
have this done by the Clerk at the first Station.</p>

<p>23. Great importance is attached to the most <b>prompt delivery</b>
of Letters, Invoices, and Despatches consigned to the care of a
Guard; and any neglect in this particular will be severely dealt
with.</p>

<p>24. Prisoners who are in charge of the Police, and persons
afflicted with insanity, must never be mixed along with the other
Passengers, but be placed in a <b>compartment</b>, and, if practicable,
in a <b>carriage, by themselves</b>.</p>

<p>25. Servants and others connected with the Railway (Directors
excepted) are required to book and pay their fare the same as
other Passengers, except the following Officers, who travel free,
and have the power to grant Passes to individuals proceeding
<b>on the Company’s business</b> <span class="lock"><b>only</b>:—</span></p>

<p class="p2 center sansserif">REGULATIONS FOR BREAKSMEN OF LUGGAGE
TRAINS.</p>

<p>1. The Breaksman or Breaksmen, as the case may be, must be
in attendance <b>60</b> minutes before the hour fixed in the Time
Bill for the departure of the Trains.</p>

<p>2. They are carefully to examine the loading and sheeting of
the waggons before starting from each Station, to insure the
protection of the goods from <b>rain</b> and <b>sparks</b>. They must also,
at every Station where the Train stops, ascertain that the loading
of the Trucks has not moved, and specially that it does not
<b>overhang</b> the sides.</p>

<p>3. They are to be careful to ascertain that the axles of the
waggons are properly <b>greased</b> before starting from a Station.</p>

<p>4. The Head Breaksman, where there are two, is responsible
for seeing that the <b>Signal Lamps</b> are attached to the Train, and
that on arrival they are delivered to the Lamp-man. He is also
responsible to have these Lamps lighted at Sunset and during a
Fog.</p>

<p>5. The Breaksman is to enter on his Way Bill any <b>delays</b>
or <b>casualties</b>, and report the same on arrival to the proper
officer. When any waggons are left on the road that should
have been taken forward, the Breaksman must instantly on arrival
give notice of the same.</p>

<p>6. The Breaksman is to receive and enter on his Way Bill
such despatch-bags, parcels, invoices, and letters, as may be delivered
to him, and must be very particular to deliver correctly
any parcels of Goods which may be intrusted to him between
roadside Stations, and to forward to their address without delay
all <b>letters</b>, <b>despatches</b>, and <b>invoices</b> consigned to his care.</p>

<p>7. He is to examine the <b>labels</b> on the waggons, and compare
with the greatest exactness the destination and number upon
each waggon with those in the Way Bill. He is to notice any
discrepancies in the latter, and correct any errors before starting.</p>

<p>8. The Breaksman is to be provided with a few spare centre
chains, a crowbar, fire-bucket and rope, a case of fog signals, and
hand signal lamp; also a small Red Flag and a White one—the
Red Flag being a Signal to stop, and the White one to proceed.</p>

<p>9. Whenever a Train is stopped at any intermediate Station,
or on the Line, it is the special duty of the Breaksman to see
that the <b>contents</b> of the waggons are not interfered with, and
that the proper <b>Signals</b> are given when the Line is obstructed.
In case of a break-down or other stoppage on the main Line, he
is to go back <b>600</b> yards, or until he meet a Policeman, making
the proper signal with a Red Flag by day, or Red Lamp by
night, or in foggy weather by placing a <b>Fog Signal</b> on the Rail
to stop any approaching Train, leaving the waggons in the
charge of the Engineman; if in going the above-named distance
he does not meet a Policeman, he must not leave the place until
relieved. (See <a href="#Rule_17">Rule 17</a>, p. 182.)</p>

<p>10. No person is allowed to <b>walk</b> or <b>climb</b> over the tops of
the waggon sheets.</p>

<p>11. The Breaksman is to make himself acquainted with the
Time of the Passenger Trains passing all parts of the Line, and
when likely to be overtaken remind the Engineman immediately
to <b>shunt</b> into a siding out of the way of the approaching Train,
and in passing warn the Police signal-men of their intention.</p>

<p>12. The Breaksmen are positively prohibited from allowing
any one to <b>ride in the Breaksman’s box</b>, or on the Train, without
written authority; and any disobedience to this order will
be punished.</p>

<p class="center larger"><a id="Section_7"></a><span class="smcap">Section <abbr title="Seven">VII.</abbr></span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2 center sansserif">REGULATIONS FOR STATION MASTERS AND
CLERKS.</p>

<p>1. Every Officer in charge of a Station is to be answerable for
the Office and Buildings, and the Company’s Property there.
He is also to be responsible for the faithful and efficient discharge
of the duties devolving upon all the Company’s Servants at the
Station.</p>

<p>2. He is to see that all general and other orders are duly
entered and executed, and that all books and returns are regularly
written up, and neatly kept.</p>

<p>3. He is to take care that all the Servants at his Station behave
respectfully and civilly to Passengers of every class, and
that no gratuities from the public are received by them under
any circumstances.</p>

<p>4. He is to inspect daily all rooms and places in connection
with the Station, in order to see that they are neat and clean.</p>

<p>5. He is to take care that all the Servants at his Station come
on duty clean in their persons and clothes, shaved, and with their
shoes brushed.</p>

<p>6. He is also to cause the Station to be kept clear of weeds,
and have the ballast raked and preserved in neat order. He
must be careful that all stores supplied for the Station are prudently
and economically used, and that there is no waste of gas,
oil, coal, or stationery.</p>

<p>7. He is to report, without delay, neglect of duty on the part
of any one under his charge; and in case of complaint against
any man, he is to communicate the particulars as soon as possible,
so that the offender may be sent to head-quarters, if the
case require it.</p>

<p>8. No Station Master is allowed to be absent without leave
from the Superintendent of his Division, except from illness,
in which case he must immediately inform the Superintendent,
and take care that some competent person is intrusted with the
duties.</p>

<p>9. Carriages and Waggons are never to be allowed to stand
on the main Line, but must be placed in a siding, and at night
the wheels must be securely scotched.</p>

<p>10. No Engine, Carriage, or Waggon, must be allowed to
shunt or cross the main Line if a Train is expected, unless the
proper signal shall have been previously sent back.</p>

<p>11. On the arrival of a Train at a Station, the Red Signal is
to be shown, and continued for five minutes after the departure
of the Train. In foggy weather the Auxiliary Signals must
always be lighted, and used as shown by Rule 13, p. 165.</p>

<p>12. Every exertion must be made for the expeditious despatch
of the Station duties, and for insuring punctuality in the Trains.</p>

<p>13. No Train is to be started before the time stated in the
Tables.</p>

<p>14. As a general rule, Passenger Trains are to take precedence
of Luggage Trains; and Goods Trains must not be started from
any Station when Passenger Trains are due. This Regulation,
however, will be subject to modification, agreeably to the circumstances
of the Trains, the state of the weather, the weight of
the load, and the character of the Engine:—Thus, a light
through Goods or Cattle Train, on a clear day or night, with a
good Engine, may be started before a Passenger Train which is
due, should the latter have to stop at all the Stations. Again,
if, from facts which may come to the knowledge of the Station
Agent, by means of the Electric Telegraph or otherwise, the
Passenger Train which is due may not be expected for some
time, the Agent will be justified in despatching the Goods Train,
taking care in this case specially to warn the Engineman of the
Passenger Train, when it arrives, informing him the precise
time when the Luggage Train was despatched and where ordered
to shunt.</p>

<p>15. On a Line like the London and North-Western, where
the Traffic in Goods and Passengers is so intermingled, much
must be left to the discretion of the Station Agents, but the discretionary
power must be exercised with great prudence and
caution. Every endeavour, consistent with safety, must be made
to expedite the departure of the Goods Trains from the Roadside
Stations; and no delay should be permitted unless obstruction
to Passenger Trains may be reasonably apprehended.</p>

<p>16. In deciding in difficult cases whether to despatch a Luggage
Train or not, the opinions of the Engineman and Breaksman,
who must be best acquainted with the state of the Engine
and Load, should be obtained, and great weight should be
attached to these recommendations, but the decision on the course
to be pursued will still rest with the Station Agent.</p>

<p>17. A Return of the Delays at each Station is in future to be
submitted to the Manager, which will enable the Directors to
appreciate the activity of the Station Agents.</p>

<p>18. The above regulations will be facilitated in their operations
by the limit to which the Directors have restricted the
weight of the Trains. As a general rule, no Train will be
allowed to exceed forty Loaded Waggons; and whenever this
number shall be exceeded, special notice will be given. When
the number of Waggons to be despatched exceeds forty, thereby
requiring another Engine, the load will be divided, and
despatched in <em>Two Trains</em>, at an interval of <em>Ten Minutes</em>.</p>

<p>19. Waggons of Merchandise are always to have precedence
over Coke, except written instructions are produced to the contrary,
or the Agent is satisfied, by verbal explanations, that the
case is urgent, and that deviation from the rule would be expedient.
When this occurs it is to be noted in the Report.</p>

<p>20. In order to guide the Agents in deciding on the policy of
attaching Waggons to passing Trains, the Locomotive Department
will in future supply the Drivers with a Certificate of each
Luggage-Engine’s capability; stating the average number of
Loaded Waggons which may be attached to it, in good and bad
weather respectively; and this Certificate will be considered to
remain in force until withdrawn by the Superintendent of the
Locomotive Department.</p>

<p>21. Empty Waggons will be worked down by spare or
returned Engines, as the case may be. Three empty Waggons
will be considered equal to Two loaded ones.</p>

<p>22. The through Trains between Liverpool, Manchester, the
Midland Line, and London, which do not take up Roadside
Goods, are to be pushed forward as rapidly as is consistent with
safety.</p>

<p>23. When a Special Train has to be despatched from a Station,
a Red Board or Red Flag by day and an additional Tail Lamp
by night must be attached to the preceding Train.</p>

<p>24. An account of all unclaimed Luggage found at the Station
is to be sent to the Clearing-house on a form furnished for that
purpose.</p>

<p>25. The Clerks at the several Stations are to deliver Tickets
to all persons booking their places for conveyance by the Railway,
and no person is to be allowed to pass on the platform
without producing his Ticket.</p>

<p>26. If the Guard or Station Clerk have reason to suspect that
any Passenger is or has been travelling upon the Railway without
having paid any Fare or the proper Fare, he may require such
person to produce his Ticket; and every Passenger before leaving
the Company’s premises at the end of his journey is to be
required to deliver up his Ticket. If any Passenger shall refuse
or be unable to produce a proper Ticket, or shall commit any
other offence against the Bye-laws, Rules, and Regulations of the
Company relating to Travellers by the Railway, the case shall
be immediately investigated by the Chief Clerk of the Station
where the occurrence may take place, who is to exercise his discretion
as to the proceedings to be taken, always reporting what
has been done.</p>

<p>27. The power of detention is to be exercised with great
caution, and never where the address of the party is known, or
adequate security offered for his appearance to answer the
charge. When it shall be necessary to detain any party, such
detention shall not continue for a longer period than is absolutely
necessary, but he shall be conveyed before a Magistrate with as
little delay as possible.</p>

<p>28. Passengers not producing their Tickets are to be required
to deposit the amount of the whole Fare from the place whence
the Train started until the inquiry can be made, in order to
ascertain whether the Fare has been actually paid or not, and in
every case the circumstances must be inquired into without delay
and reported.</p>

<p>29. The power of detention for offences is limited to the
person of the Passenger and does not extend to his Luggage, but
the Luggage may be detained for the Fare in case it is not
intended to proceed against the Owner for a Penalty, such Luggage
being subject to a lien for the amount of the Fare.</p>

<p>30. As it is the <em>intent</em> which constitutes the offence, it is very
desirable that the power of detention should be exercised with
caution and discretion, as cases may frequently occur of persons
travelling beyond the distance for which they have paid their
Fare unintentionally, or even against their wish and to their
inconvenience; and the right of detention is applicable only in
cases of what is termed Over Riding to parties who <em>knowingly</em>
and <em>wilfully</em> proceed beyond the place to which they are booked,
not only without previously paying the additional Fare for the
additional distance, but also with <em>intent to avoid payment
thereof</em>.</p>

<p class="p2 center sansserif">REGULATIONS FOR INSPECTORS OF POLICE.</p>

<p>1. Every Inspector is to <b>walk</b> over his district, and to report
to the Superintendent of his division any irregularity he may
detect.</p>

<p>2. Every Inspector is to see that the Policemen, Pointsmen,
and Gatesmen in his district are at their posts—<b>clean</b> in their
persons, sober, and attentive to their duty; and to ascertain that
they are <b>conversant</b> with their orders, and that the Points are
in good working order, <b>cleaned</b>, and <b>oiled</b>.</p>

<p>3. He is to see that each Police Box has a <b>copy</b> of the standing
orders relative to Police Signals and Duties, and a copy of
any order specially relating to the men at that particular post.</p>

<p>4. Every Inspector is to have a <b>list</b> of the names and places
of abode of every Policeman in his district, so that in case of
need he can summon them.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">


<div class="chapter">
<p class="center larger"><a id="Section_9"></a><span class="smcap">Section <abbr title="Nine">IX.</abbr></span></p>
</div>

<p class="p2 center sansserif">REGULATIONS FOR POLICEMEN AND
POINTSMEN.</p>

<p>1. Every Policeman on duty is to stand upon the Line <b>clear</b>
of the rails, and to give the proper signal on the passing of an
Engine.</p>

<p>2. Every Policeman will be supplied with a <b>whistle</b>, to aid in
calling the attention of the next officer in communication with
him to a signal; and no signal must be considered to be received
until answered by the Policeman to whom it is passed.</p>

<p>3. On a Train stopping at a Station after sunset, the Policeman
on duty is to see that the Tail and Side Lamps are lighted and in
order, and, if not, he is to report the same to the Guard of the
Train, as well as to the Clerk on duty.</p>

<p>4. On a Goods or Coal Train stopping at a Station, the Policeman
on duty is to ascertain from the Breaksman at which Station
the Train is <b>next to stop</b>, that he may inform the Engineman and
Guard of the following Train. This precaution is more especially
enjoined during foggy weather.</p>

<p>5. On a Policeman having to stop a Train, he is to tell the
Engineman the cause, and then let the Train proceed, unless he
has orders to detain it, in which case he is to desire the Engineman
to draw on until the whole Train is well <b>within</b> the Signal
Post, to admit of a following Train stopping at the Signal, without
risk of collision.</p>

<p>6. When a Train stopping at a Station extends beyond the
Signal Post, the Policeman on duty is to go back in <b>rear</b> of the
Train with his Hand Signal, to a distance sufficient to ensure its
being well observed by the Engineman of any other Engine that
may be following.</p>

<p>7. This precaution, though at all times necessary, is more
particularly so with the Up Trains at Weedon, Roade, and
Leighton.</p>

<p>8. The Policeman stationed at the New Canal Bridge, near
Birmingham, when he cannot discern the Signal at the Junction
of the Gloucester Railway, is to show the <b>Green Signal</b> to every
Engine passing towards Birmingham, and the Engineman is then
to bring his Engine to a stand at the Ticket Platform unless
there signalled to proceed.</p>

<p>9. At the junction with the Midland at Rugby—the Bedford
at Bletchley—the Aylesbury at Cheddington—the Peterborough
at Blisworth—the Leamington at Coventry—the Manchester and
the Chester at Crewe—the Macclesfield at Cheadle, where
Stationary Signals are placed, the Policeman is to keep the Red
Signal always turned on to the <b>Branch Line</b>, to prevent an
Engine passing to the Main Line until he has ascertained that
the Main Line is clear, when he is to turn the Signal off the
Branch and on to the Main Line.</p>

<p><b>Note.</b>—The Trent Valley is henceforth to be considered the
<b>Main</b> Line, and the Rugby and Birmingham, and Stafford and
Birmingham, the Branches.</p>

<p>10. Every Engineman on a Branch Line must bring his
Engine to a stand in foggy weather <b>before</b> he reaches the Junction-points,
and not enter on the Main Line till he shall have
ascertained how long the preceding Train has passed; the
<b>Policeman</b> is to give all the information required.</p>

<p>11. Policemen are hereby apprised that, except in cases of
emergency, none but Regular Trains are to be permitted to
travel in a <b>FOG</b>; and on these occasions when a Train stops at a
Station, the Auxiliary Signals must always be used, as shown
by Rule 13, page 165.</p>

<p>12. Policemen must also take notice, that, to avoid risk of
collision on Single Lines, no extra Engine, with or without a
Train, will be allowed to pass along the Line without <b>previous
notice</b>.</p>

<p>13. Every Policeman is supplied with <b>Detonating</b> Signals to
place on the Rails in foggy weather, and he is on these occasions
to use them in addition to the ordinary Red Signal. (<cite>See <a href="#Section_3">Regulations
for Use of Fog Signals.</a></cite>)</p>

<p>14. Every Policeman is responsible for his Stationary as well
as Hand Signal Lamp being well <b>trimmed</b>, and showing a clear
and distinct light.</p>

<p>15. The Policemen generally are not to allow strangers to
<b>trespass</b> on the Line without written authority, and they are to
report any occurrence of this nature to their Inspector. They
will also respect any orders which the officers in charge of
Stations may think necessary.</p>

<p>16. On a Policeman stopping a Train at the entrance to one
of the long Tunnels, from another Train having passed within
<b>ten</b> minutes, he is not to detain the Train beyond <b>two</b> minutes,
but simply to inform the Engineman and Guard of the character
of the Train in advance, and the time that has elapsed since it
passed.</p>

<p>17. Should a Train issue from one of the long Tunnels, at
which Police are stationed, without the <b>Tail Lamp</b> on the last
carriage, the Policeman on duty is immediately to walk back
through the Tunnel with his lamp to ascertain whether a
carriage has not been left behind, and, should this be the case,
he is then to go on to the other end to instruct the Policeman
there stationed to put on his Red Signal to stop any Engine from
entering the Tunnel.</p>

<p>18. The Policemen stationed at Tunnels and intermediate
Stations are directed to be very particular in making the Signals
according to the Regulations. (<cite>See <a href="#Section_2">Signals.</a></cite>)</p>

<p>19. In all cases where Telegraphic communication is laid
through a Tunnel, the Policeman at the entrance thereof is to
sound the <b>Bell</b> on a Train going into the Tunnel, and the Policeman
at the other extremity is to respond to the Signal on the
Train emerging from it.</p>

<p>20. The Policeman stationed at the South entrance of the
Primrose Tunnel is to sound the <b>Alarum</b> as soon as an Up Train
enters the Tunnel, that the Camden Station may be made aware
of the approach of a Train, and, if a Goods or Cattle Train, he
is to turn it into the siding. Should it be a Passenger Train,
the Policeman at Chalk Farm Bridge is to pass the Signal to the
Euston Station.</p>

<p>21. When the Policeman at the South entrance of the Primrose
Tunnel cannot distinguish the Signal at Chalk Farm Bridge,
he is to show the <b>Green</b> Signal to every Engine passing towards
Camden Station, and the Engineman is then to bring his Engine
to a stand at the same Bridge unless signalled to proceed.</p>

<p>22. The Policeman in charge of the facing Points at the
summit of the Incline at Camden is not to move them to allow
an Engine to run into the siding, unless the Engineman motions
with his hand. (See <a href="#Rule_48">Rule 48</a>, page 176.)</p>

<p>23. The duties of Pointsmen in charge of Switches are very
simple, easily understood and remembered, and are at the same
time not heavy, but they require great <b>care</b>, <b>attention</b>, and
<b>watchfulness</b>, for any neglect may cause very serious accidents;
Policemen are, therefore, warned always to be on the alert, and
cautious in the discharge of their duty as Pointsmen.</p>

<p>24. The Pointsman is to be careful in keeping his Switches
<b>clear</b> and well <b>oiled</b>: and whenever a Train has passed over, he
is to see that no particle of coal or dirt has dropped within the
Points, so as to prevent them from closing, and also that they
are replaced in the <b>proper position</b>. He is also to try his Points
before the passing through of a Train, that he may be thoroughly
satisfied there is no impediment to their true working.</p>

<p>25. Where, from the peculiarity of the Line, it is necessary
to employ facing Points, these precautions become <b>doubly</b> important.</p>

<p>26. Whenever, from the passage of a Train, the Points, Crossings,
or Guide-rail receive injury or strain, or the rails themselves
are <b>split</b> or <b>chipped</b>, the circumstance must immediately be
reported.</p>

<p>27. In order to assist in discriminating Luggage Trains at
night from Passenger Trains, the former carry a <b>Green</b> light on
the Buffer-plank; but it must be understood that this is intended
merely as an auxiliary signal, and is not to be <b>relied on</b> for
turning a Train into a siding, which is only to be done when the
Policeman on duty shall have <b>satisfied himself</b> as to the character
of the Train.</p>

<p class="p2 center sansserif">REGULATIONS FOR GATEMEN AT LEVEL
CROSSINGS.</p>

<p>1. Every Gateman will be provided with Day and Night
Signals, which he must keep in proper order.</p>

<p>2. Gates must always be kept <b>closed</b> across a road, except
when required to be opened to allow the Railway to be passed.</p>

<p>3. Before opening the Gates, the Gateman is to satisfy himself
that a Train is not in sight; he will then exhibit his Red
light, and always allow the Signal to remain until the Railway
is <b>clear</b> and the Gates closed.</p>

<p>4. If an Engine follow another within <b>three minutes</b>, the
Danger Signal is to be shown; from three to seven minutes, the
Caution Signal must be exhibited.</p>

<p>5. In all cases, the Gateman, when signalling, is to stand on
the <b>opposite side</b> of the Railway, that he may be seen by the
Driver of the Train.</p>

<p>6. The Gatemen must make themselves well acquainted with
the Signals, as laid down in <b>Sections 2 and 3</b>.</p>

<p class="p2 center sansserif">REGULATIONS FOR BALLAST ENGINEMEN
AND PLATE-LAYERS.</p>

<p>1. When a Ballast Engine is discharging or taking in ballast,
blocks, sleepers, or other materials, on the Main Line, the Engineman
is to send a Ballastman back <b>600</b> yards with a red
signal-flag; and this Ballastman is to remain on the look-out till
the Ballast Train is ready to move, and he is to stop any approaching
Train, and inform the Driver of the position of the
Ballast Train. (See <a href="#Rule_17">Rule 17</a>, page 182.)</p>

<p>2. All persons in charge of Ballast Trains are to obey the
orders of the Company’s Agents, Inspectors, and Police, so far
as relates to the time of their running on the Line; and no Ballast
Engineman is to <b>leave a siding</b> in front of an expected
Train, or without the permission of the Officer in charge of the
point.</p>

<p>3. No ballasting is to be carried on in <b>foggy weather</b>, except
under urgent circumstances, or by express permission.</p>

<p>4. Ballast Enginemen are to take particular care always to
have a proper supply of Coke and Water in their Tenders, so as
to prevent the possibility of any detention on the Line from
deficiency; and they are also to take care to attach only such
number of waggons as can be drawn with certainty, and on no
account to leave their Engines while standing on the Main Line.</p>

<p>5. A Red Signal must always be stationed <b>800</b> yards back
before a Rail is taken out, or any obstruction caused to the Main
Line. (See <a href="#Rule_17">Rule 17</a>, page 182.)</p>

<p>6. A Green Signal must be stationed <b>400</b> yards back whenever
the state of the Line requires that the Train should proceed
with caution.</p>

<p>7. No rail, block, or chair, is to be removed in a <b>fog</b>, or
during the night, except by express permission from the Resident
Engineer; and in all cases, before taking out a Rail, the
Foreman is to have at the spot a perfect Rail in readiness to
replace it.</p>

<p>8. No Truck or Lorry is to be placed on the Line except for
the conveyance of materials; and any Truck or Lorry so used
is to be followed by a man carrying a Red Signal, at a distance
of <b>400</b> yards at least. No Lorry is, under any circumstances,
to be moved on the wrong Line.</p>

<p>9. No Truck or Lorry is to be used in a <b>fog</b>; and the wheels
of Lorries must be constantly <b>locked</b> when not in use.</p>

<p>10. No Lorry is, under any circumstances, to be attached to
the <b>end of a Train</b>.</p>

<p>11. Should special circumstances require the use of a Lorry
in the Tunnels, or otherwise than in broad daylight, it must be
followed by a man with a Red Light, and notice must be given
by the Foreman to the Policeman at the entrance to the Tunnel
of the time he expects the Lorry will be required in the Tunnel,
that the Policeman may keep on the <b>Red Signal</b> during the
whole time, and caution any Engineman entering in the Tunnel.</p>

<p>12. Every Overlooker is to have a <b>list</b> of the name and
abode of every Foreman of his district, that, in case of accident,
he may be enabled to summon them immediately to assist in any
way that may be deemed necessary; and should any obstruction
take place, caused by snow, frost, slips, or other sudden emergency,
he is instantly to collect the required strength to overcome
the obstacle.</p>

<p>13. The Plate-layers are to desist from work when a Train is
within <b>400</b> yards, and the Foreman must order his men to move
to the side of the road clear of both Lines, to secure the men
from the risk of accident by Trains running in opposite directions.
If working in a Tunnel, and Trains are approaching in
both directions, the Plate-layers must lie down between the two
lines of way, till the Trains have passed.</p>

<p>14. If a Passenger Train approach within <b>ten minutes</b> of a
Coal or Ballast Train, the Plate-layers must give the Signal to
proceed <b>slowly</b>.</p>

<p>15. In the event of any Engineman neglecting to comply
with the Signal to stop, or to proceed cautiously, as the case
may be, the Foreman of the Plate-layers is to <b>report</b> the circumstance,
in order that proper notice may be taken of it.</p>

<p>16. Every Overlooker is responsible that all <b>loose timber</b>,
<b>stones</b>, <b>rails</b>, <b>chairs</b>, or other materials, as well as the workmen’s
tools, are removed from the road, and the Line kept clear of interruption
of any kind.</p>

<p>17. The whole Line is to be <b>inspected</b> every morning before
the arrival of the first <b>Up</b> and <b>Down</b> Train, and care must be
taken that the Rails are in gauge, and the Keys driven home.</p>

<p>18. On learning that an <b>accident</b> has occurred, a Plate-layer
is to proceed with all possible despatch to the next gang, from
which a Plate-layer will in like manner run to the next more
distant Plate-layer, till information of the accident has by this
means reached the Station.</p>

<p>19. Having communicated the information, the Plate-layers
are immediately to return to give their assistance.</p>

<p>20. Every Foreman having been sworn in as a Special Constable
is required to order off all persons <b>trespassing</b> within the
fences on his district, and if such persons persist in remaining
he is to take them to the nearest Station, and give them into the
charge of the Company’s Police.</p>

<p>21. The Foreman is also to report if any gates which the
owners or occupiers of land are required to keep shut have been
<b>left open</b>, that the parties may be charged with the penalties,
and any instance of sheep or cattle being on the Lines or Slopes
is also to be duly reported.</p>

<p>22. Every Plate-layer is to make himself <b>duly acquainted</b>
with the code of Signals in use on the Railway, as detailed in
<b>Sections 2 and 3</b>.</p>

<p class="p2 center sansserif">REGULATIONS FOR GUARDS AND TUNNEL
BREAKSMEN AT LIME-STREET.</p>


<p class="center">GOING DOWN THE TUNNEL.</p>

<p>1. The moment a Train arrives at Edge Hill, the Tunnel-breaksman,
whose turn it is to go down the Tunnel, is to <b>examine</b>
how many <b>Breaks</b> there are on the Train, and, before the Train
is allowed to start, must be perfectly satisfied that the requisite
number are in good working order, and must report to the
Superintendent on duty that they are so.</p>

<p>2. The Tunnel-breaksman must see that the <b>Guard</b> of the
Train is at his post before the Train starts.</p>

<p>3. No Train is, on any account, to go down the Tunnel
without a <b>Tunnel-breaksman</b>.</p>

<p>4. Trains going down the Tunnel are never to be allowed to
exceed in speed <b>ten miles</b> an hour.</p>

<p>5. In some instances Trains have been allowed to acquire a
considerable velocity before the Breaks were applied, the Breaksman
relying on the power of the Breaks to stop the Train.
This practice is most strictly <b>forbidden</b>; at no period of the
descent must the Trains be at a greater speed than <b>ten miles</b> an
hour; the Breaks must be applied gradually, and the Breaksman
must be sure at all times that he has perfect control over his
speed.</p>

<p>6. The Guard of the Train and Tunnel-breaksman will be
held <b>equally</b> responsible for the safety of the Train.</p>

<p>7. No Train is to go down without a Guard and one Breaksman;
when the Train exceeds <b>ten</b> coaches, there must be an
<b>extra</b> Breaksman; if it exceed <b>fifteen</b> coaches, two extra
Breaksmen.</p>

<p>8. No Train is to follow another Train down the Tunnel
without an interval of <b>five</b> minutes.</p>

<p>9. No Train of any description is to be allowed to pass down
the Tunnel without the <b>Signal</b> having been previously given.</p>

<p>10. Whenever, from a number of Trains going down the
Tunnel, there is a deficiency of Breaksmen at Edge Hill, the
Breaksman, on applying to the Superintendent of the Station at
Lime Street, is to be sent up without waiting for a Train.</p>


<p class="p2 center">GOING UP THE TUNNEL.</p>

<p>11. The Tunnel-breaksman in going up is to take charge of
the messenger. Before starting, he will take notice of the
<b>position of the Breaks</b>, and in case of the rope or messenger
giving way, he will be required immediately to get to the Break
and put it on fast, so as to prevent the Train going down the
Tunnel.</p>

<p>12. In a Train of <b>five</b> coaches, the Train-guard will be
sufficient; but if the Train exceeds that number, there must be a
Tunnel-breaksman, and for every additional <b>five</b> coaches there
must be an extra Breaksman. No more than <b>fifteen</b> coaches
must at any time be taken up the Tunnel at once; and any Train
exceeding that number must be taken up at twice.</p>

<p>13. No <b>Waggons</b> are to be sent down the Tunnels without
<b>special</b> permission.</p>

<p>14. The Station Master at Lime Street will be answerable for
the <b>efficiency</b> of the Breaksman, and he, or the Assistants on duty
at Lime Street, will see to the carrying out of the regulations.</p>

<p>15. The Station Master, or the Assistants on duty at Edge
Hill, will also do the same at the Tunnel top; and before a
Train is allowed to start, the Officer on duty will be required to
see that the <b>Guard and Breaksman are properly placed</b>.</p>

<p>16. The Officer on duty is required to report forthwith to the
Assistant Manager, Lime Street, any instance of a Train being
allowed to run into the Station <b>too quickly</b>, even although no
damage may have ensued.</p>


<p class="p2 center sansserif"><a id="Section_12a"></a>REGULATIONS FOR WAPPING TUNNEL,
LIVERPOOL.</p>

<p>17. No person, unless in service of the Company, is allowed
to enter the Tunnel without permission of the Manager or
Engineer, who will give a <b>printed pass</b> to strangers, when
required.</p>

<p>18. On arrival of each Down Train at Edge Hill, it is the
duty of the Tunnel-breaksmen to examine particularly the
<b>Coupling Chains</b>, the <b>Breaks</b>, and the Loading of the Waggons,
before they are brought over the <b>bank head</b> of the Tunnel.
After doing which, the senior one of them must <b>sign the Register-book</b>,
for assurance that all is right, safe, and ready. The
same Breaksman must then go down with the Train to the
bottom of the Tunnel, taking care that they hold full and
complete control over the speed of the Train.</p>

<p>19. Every train is to be brought to a complete stand upon the
bank head, whilst the requisite number of good Breaks are
<b>pinned down</b>. The Breaksmen are required not to allow the
Train to attain a greater rate of speed than <b>four to five</b> miles an
hour in any part of the Tunnel, or fifteen minutes in time of
descending, in order that they may be able to get off the
Waggons without danger to themselves, and put down or take
up any of the Breaks, as necessary.</p>

<p>20. When a Down Train consists wholly of loaded Waggons,
and there is not any Break Waggon at hand to be sent down in
front, the Breaksmen are first to see that at least <b>one-third</b> of
the Waggons are provided with good and efficient Breaks;
otherwise they must not venture to proceed with them down the
Tunnel, until the deficiency is supplied by attaching an adequate
number of empty Waggons, with serviceable Breaks, from the
stock in the Sidings: but the Break Waggon must, if possible,
in all cases be used.</p>

<p>21. When a Train is composed of loaded and empty Waggons,
two empty are to be considered equal to one loaded. Not more
than <b>thirty-five loaded</b> Waggons may be taken down the Tunnel
at any one time, and two Breaksmen must attend each Train.
None but the regularly appointed Tunnel-breaksmen must ever
attempt to convoy a Train.</p>

<p>22. Signal Lamps and Hand Lamps must be kept properly
trimmed and burning. A Red Signal Lamp, lighted, must
always be fixed on the rear of the last Waggon going down the
Tunnel, and a Green Signal Lamp lighted and fixed upon the
most conspicuous part of the front Waggon in the same Train.
They must both be returned to Edge Hill by the first set up.
No persons must ever leave any Waggon standing upon the Up
Line within the Tunnel, nor upon the Down Line, without
fixing a well-lighted Red Signal Lamp thereon, and remaining
with it until removed to the bottom. The signal to <b>stop</b> must
be made by waving the Hand Lamp <b>Up and Down</b>. The man
on duty at the Wheel must look out for Waggons coming Down,
and pass the word to the Breaksman whether or not the Line is
clear; the exchange of such Signal to be made by waving the
Hand Lamps <b>horizontally</b>, and then the Breaksman may <b>with
caution</b> proceed. The Signal to “<em>come forward</em>” to be made
by waving the Hand Lamps <b>round</b>.</p>

<p>23. Each set of Waggons drawn up the Tunnel to consist of
not more than <b>six</b>, until further orders. The man on duty at
the Wheel must examine the Endless Rope, the Messengers, the
Coupling Chains, the Van Doors, and the Loads upon the
Waggons, to see that all is right and safe to pass upwards, that
the Coupling Chains are properly hooked, that the last Waggon
is provided with a good and powerful Break, and then the same
Breaksman must proceed with the set, and look out for Down
Trains, to apprize the other men in charge thereof whereabouts
any Waggons are before them, to report any impediments in
the Tunnel to the Superintendent or Goods Manager.</p>

<p>24. When the Rails on the Bank Head, or within the Tunnel,
are wet and slippery, they must be sprinkled with <b>sand</b>, a large
stock of which is kept constantly at the top of the Tunnel to
supply the Break Waggons.</p>

<p>25. All Breaksmen are expected to take charge of and deliver
the Despatch Bags, Parcels, &amp;c., as sent Up and Down the
Tunnel; to keep in repair the Endless Ropes, Messengers, and
Drag Lines; and whenever <em>all</em> the Breaksmen are unavoidably
absent from the Bank Head, the large <b>wooden chock</b> upon the
Down Line, near the Tunnel Mouth, must always be put across
the Rails, and a man placed in charge until the return of one of
the Breaksmen to relieve him. The Gates to be closed every
night before 12 o’clock.</p>

down it.</p>

<p>2. The Bankrider is carefully to inspect the condition of every
Train, and never attempt to move it until perfectly satisfied of

<p><span class="smcap">Section 14.</span>]—That (if upon the hearing of any such complaint
he shall think fit) it shall be lawful for such Justice, instead
of deciding upon the matter of complaint summarily, to
commit the person or persons charged with such offence for trial
for the same at the Quarter Sessions for the county or place
wherein such offence shall have been committed, and to order
that any such person so committed shall be imprisoned and detained
in any of Her Majesty’s gaols or houses of correction in
the said county or place in the mean time, or to take bail for his
appearance, with or without sureties, in his discretion; and every
such person so offending and convicted before such Court of
Quarter Sessions as aforesaid (which said Court is hereby required
to take cognizance of and hear and determine such complaint) shall
be liable in the discretion of such Court to be imprisoned, with
or without hard labour, for any term not exceeding two years.</p>

in such manner as to obstruct any Engine or Carriage using any
Railway, or to endanger the safety of persons conveyed in or upon
the same, or shall aid or assist therein, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,
and, being convicted thereof, shall be liable, at the discretion
of the Court before which he shall have been convicted,
to be imprisoned, with or without hard labour, for any term not
exceeding two years.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><i>For Punishment of Persons Obstructing the Officers of any
Railway Company, or Trespassing upon any Railway.</i></p>

impede any Officer or Agent of any Railway Company in the
execution of his duty upon any Railway, or upon or in any of the
Stations or other Works or Premises connected therewith; or if
any person shall wilfully trespass upon any Railway, or any of
the Stations or other Works or Premises connected therewith,
and shall refuse to quit the same upon request to him made by
any Officer or Agent of the said Company, every such person so
offending, and all others aiding and assisting therein, shall and
may be seized and detained by any such Officer or Agent, or any
person whom he may call to his assistance, until such offender or
offenders can be conveniently taken before some Justice of the
Peace for the county or place wherein such offence shall be committed,
and, where convicted before such Justice as aforesaid (who
is hereby authorised and required upon complaint to him upon
oath to take cognizance thereof and to act summarily in the premises),
